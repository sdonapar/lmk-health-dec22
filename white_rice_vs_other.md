# White Rice vs Other

A question often asked of me is what is the best rice to eat or is white rice okay or should one change over to brown rice. 
If you are willing to try nonwhite rice than following rice are very good choices listed in order of declining nutrition value. 
1. Wild rice
2. Black rice
3. Purple rice
4. Red rice 
5. Brown rice
6. White rice

Brown rice has slightly more fiber than white rice. In one cup of brown rice you have 3.2 gram fiber instead of 1.7 gram in white rice. If you are consuming Standard American Diet (SAD), you hardly have any fiber in your diet so replacing one cup of rice from whit to brown may increase you fiber consumption by as much as 20-30 percent which is a significant improvement. In PBWF diet you daily fiber consumption is very high and replacing while rice with brown rice makes a negligible difference. So my recommendation is to eat which ever rice you like or your recipe calls for. 
One problem with brown rice is that it has arsenic which is very harmful. So it is a trade off. The issue of arsenic in rice is dependent on the location where the rice is grown. The problem in US is worse than in other places. 
But the point that I have tried to highlight is that just because a food is slightly processed as in white rice, it does not make it unhealthy. 
Processed food are bad for many reasons:
1. Unhealthy processes change the nature of the food. 
2. Many additives are added which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) but very unhealthy never the less. For example hydrogenated oils are classified as GRAS even though we l ow they are very unhealthy. 
3. Heavy extraction is done as in oils and sugars and high fructose corn syrup. 

None of the above apply to white rice. Please watch linked videos on the subject.
