1.  Non starchy Veggies: 8 oz (50 cal)
2. Low protein fruits: 4 oz (75 cal) 
3. Starchy Veggies: 3 oz (90)
4. Tapioca: 2 oz (200) 
5. Peanuts: 1/4 oz (40) 
6. Flaxseed: 1 tsp (25) 
7. Vegetable stock & spices (20)

Total Calories = 500

Add spices generously
———————————
Replacing Tapioca with 
- Chestnut Flour 2 oz (205 calories) or 
- Barnyard Millet 2.5 oz (210 calories) 
adds another 2-3% protein.

———————————
•Chestnut Flour is second best choice after Tapioca. It has 5.4% protein. 

•Barnyard Millet is okay. It has 8% protein. It is also 
called Sama ka Rice

•Amaranth is not recommended as it has 15% protein which is worse that regular rice or wheat.
