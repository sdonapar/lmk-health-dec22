# Welcome 

Welcome all to this health group. The purpose of this group is to empower its members to take control of their health and get off  most if not all medications they might be taking for any chronic conditions. We achieve this by educating them in plant based whole food (PBWF) diet and active, Intermittent (IF) and Therapeutic fasting based lifestyle. 

Before we proceed some housekeeping rules:
1. No greeting messages.
2. No forwards unless accompanied with your personal detailed comments. 
3. All discussions related to chronic health issues only.
4. If you are posting a video please post a YouTube link if available.
5. No two way conversations beyond the first round.
6. No discussion on Corona virus. 

Many members who have been referred by others may not know me so here is my introduction: 

I am Lalit M. Kapoor and I live in SanFrancisco Bay Area; Berkeley to be precise. I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1971 and moved to UCLA for my MBA in 1973. I have been living in US since. 
I was fortunate enough to find buyers for the companies I started and as a result I retired from business life in 2005. I have been pursuing health issues and anti aging field only as a passion.
Nine years ago I watched a documentary “Forks over Knives”. It resonated with me and motivated me to change my diet and lifestyle by following the advice of a group of doctors who recommend Plant Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet. I lost 50 pounds and got off five different prescription medications within 18 months including Diabetes, Hypertension, Osteo Arthritis, Hypothyroid, Gout, Sleep Apnia and seasonal allergies. Besides curing these illnesses, I felt more energetic than I had ever felt in the prior three decades, even completing my first half marathon. 
In 2017 I formed a WhatsApp group of 1971 IITK batch mates and shared what I had learned. Many of my batch mates reported similar experiences and were successful in getting off some or all medications they were taking for chronic conditions. They referred more people, one thing led to another and since then I have created over 350 different health groups and coached over 80,000 members. 
Based on that experience and new research findings in the field of nutrition and health, I have further fine tuned my recommendations. Members are now getting off their medications in as little as two weeks. How long it takes you, is a function of your medical history and your compliance to the diet and lifestyle recommendations. I made my changes at the age of 63, but I have found that others have even benefitted at the late age of 85. I will share with you some of their testimonials as we go along. 
In this group I will be writing posts and be your coach. I will attach short videos on the subject and talks by various doctors and professors at leading medical colleges like UCSF, USC, Cleveland Heart Clinic and others. Most videos are short 5-10 minutes but few talks are longer. I request you all to watch these videos because my posts will be short and not cover the subject matter in greater details. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words and a video is worth a thousand pictures. 
As we progress you can ask questions on the subject matter being covered. You will be given opportunities to ask questions periodically. My experience has shown that most initial questions get addressed in the following posts, so for this reason Q&A session will be held about once a week. I will block posting by members and open it up for a day after each week or a logical conclusion of a subject. 

During the first three weeks the focus will be on:
• What to eat and what not to eat
• When to eat and when not to eat
• How to eat and cook
• How to detoxify our body
• Physical activity
• Emotional Health
• Spiritual Health

After that during fourth week we will cover politics of Food, Pharma and Health Care industries and the role of government and media. 
The second month will be dedicated to discussions on various chronic diseases. 

After 3-4 weeks as members begin to see improvements in their diseases and health, they start sharing their progress. The experience has shown that most people who make the recommended changes are able to get off some or most medications within two months, by the time this course ends. Specially most patients of Hypertension, Diabetes and high cholesterol are able to get off medications. As other illnesses do not have such easily measurable markers, it is difficult to asses progress. Most members report feeling younger and more energetic. 

It is highly recommended that members of the group share the posts with their spouses and watch the videos and documentaries together. The enrollment in WhatsApp groups has now stopped, please don’t send any requests for adding members. The Telegram group enrollment will remain open for another week as it allows access to prior posts. I start a new group every month. Most of what I have to say will get covered in two months. The past members report to me that during the first month it takes them about 45 minutes to an hour each day to read the posts and watch the attached videos. 

Upon completion of the discussion at the end of the second month, members of this group will be invited to join the other groups of graduated members which are organized geographically. At these geographical locations continuing activities go on. 

While we were waiting for others to join, I had recommend that you watch some documentaries. The first one “Forks Over Knives” is a prerequisite for this group and hopefully you all have watched it. If not please do so ASAP. There is also a second part of this documentary called “Forks Over Knives: Extended Interviews”. Please watch that also. I will post a list of other documentaries to watch later. 

Those who are critically ill and/or facing a major decision, can write to me directly and I can forward them the posts and videos on their specific illness out of sequence. Please do not contact me on the direct line for trivial questions or questions of common interest. Those questions should only be asked in the group. There are 9 English groups and 4 regional language groups are running in parallel and over 6,000 members have joined. Some of the members are repeating the course. I request them not to get ahead of the subject matter and follow the pace. When questions are asked in any group which are relevant to all, I will share them in all groups.
Thank you.
