# Organic vs Nonorganic

The question of pesticides on fruits and vegetables always comes up and the problem is worse in India than in US. 
All fruits and vegetables need to be cleaned and washed properly. You can make your own wash by adding one teaspoon of baking soda in one liter of water. There are other solvents also like vinegar. 
I have also heard of rock salt and Turmeric being added to wash water. I am not an expert in this area. India has its own problems because after the rinse you canâ€™t wash fruits and vegetables in tap water as even that is contaminated. You may have to use boiled water or RO water for final rinse. 

Coming back to produce. I recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. 
I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided. 
Do not avoid fruits and vegetables for the fear of contamination of pesticides. Fruits and vegetables with pesticides are still healthier than no fruits and vegetables. See Dr. Gregerâ€™s and other videos on the subject.ðŸ‘‡
