# GREEN JUICE RECIPE

One point to understand before understanding juice recipe is that there in no requirement from chemical composition point of view. 
Many of you are accustomed to very precise recipes as often recommended in Ayurveda etc. Here operate very differently. The main goal is to consume green leafy vegetables and juice should be tasty so you do not feel that you are drinking some bitter concoction only for health reasons. Everybodyâ€™s taste is different so recipe can be varied freely depending upon taste. The idea is to prepare a juice which a guest after drinking a small glass would ask for more. 

Think of juice recipe as comprising of three groups of vegetables and some seeds. 

(1) The first group is "Granny Smith (or any other juicing) apples(4), lemon(2) and ginger(2 thumb size pcs.)

(2) The second group is "Celery (one bunch), cucumber (one large English or two medium regular) and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the water. You can also double the amount easily without any problem. 

(3) The third group is any one, two or three of the following (or any other) green leafy vegetables like kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beet root greens, cabbage etc. (2-3 bunches)
The third group can also be replaced with carrots and beetroots for a second juice recipe. 

(4) Add some flax seeds or Hemp seeds into juice. This takes care of some of your Omega-3 requirement and also provides some fat which helps absorption of nutrients from juice. 
How much juice this would make is function of the juicer type and quality. 
Please feel free to add other non starchy vegetables also like bottle gourd, Karelia, raw turmeric etc.. There are no restrictions. 

Juice can be stored in refrigerator for up to 72 hours in air tight bottles which are filled to the rim. Juice also can be frozen easily and kept for weeks, but you need to leave space for expansion. 
Many people ask what to do with the pulp that is ejected from the juicer. If the juicer is good quality, the pulp does not have any nutrition value and should be thrown away or used to make compost. If the pulp is wet it can be run a second time. You will know soon if additional juice is extracted from it. It is not recommended that you consume this pulp to make any food preparations. Always use additional fresh produce to do that as that would be richer in nutrients.
