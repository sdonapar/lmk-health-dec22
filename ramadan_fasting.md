# RAMADAN FASTING

In Ramadan fast practiced by Muslims all over the world, for a period of 28 days, one takes a meal just before the sunrise and fasts during the day not consuming even the water. Then after sunset they take their second meal. The gap between the meals is about 12 hours. 

A Fasting Study at UC SanDiego 
demonstrated that intermittent fasting similar to Ramadan fasting changes proteome signature in human body by changing gene expression, lowering proteins associated with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Alzheimerâ€™s, metabolic syndrome and bipolar disease and depression.
