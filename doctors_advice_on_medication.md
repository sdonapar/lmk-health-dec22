# Doctors Advice On Medications

Please do not write to me the details of your medications,  I am not a doctor and I am not interested in knowing the names of medications. 
All I need to know is, if you are taking any chronic medications and for what conditions. 
You have to ask yourself the question, why am I taking this medication for the rest of my life. 
Doctors are quick to prescribe medications because that is what they are taught in medical colleges and once you are on medication, you become a patient for the rest of your life. That means every time you need a refill you need to visit the doctor. (In India many patients are also to be blamed because if a doctor does not prescribe medication, they feel cheated). 
Getting people off medications is not a good practice. It is bad for the business. So some observations are to be made here:

1. Doctors are quick to prescribe medication. 

2. Doctors don’t know about nutrition (because it is not taught to them in medical colleges), so they prefer not to talk about nutrition with you. Also their are time constraints; too many patients are to be seen and the next patient is waiting in the other examination room. 

3. There is something called:
“Medical Standards of Care”
These standards must be followed by the doctors to maintain their license to practice. Also if the standard is not followed, the doctor can be subjected to lawsuits by the patient or his family. This may be more common in US than in India. In US “Medical Standard of Care” is established by the governing body of the speciality disciple involved. So a diabetes doctor must follow guidelines established by the “American Diabetes Association (ADA)”. If you are being treated by an Endocrinologist than he is governed by “American Association Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE)”.

4. When it comes to these governing bodies of various specialties, their primary goal is to look after the interests of their members who pay a membership fee to join them. When there is a research fining that suggests that the cutoff point to prescribe medication should be lowered they are quick to jump-in and adopt the revised guidelines. 
Later-on, if further research suggests otherwise, they are slow to adopt or refuse to adopt the new research findings. This is why you see conflicting guidelines. 
It is human nature; once you get used to higher income, no body wants to go back to lower income levels. There is a Hindi couplet that talked about it 500 years ago:

“Badhat badhat sampsti salil, man saroj badh jai, 
Ghatat ghatat, puni na ghate, varu samul kumbhlaye.”

Translation:
“As one’s wealth increases, his desires also increase, just like a lotus flower in a pond, which rises when water level rises. When water level goes down, the lotus flower is unable to adjust and it perishes.”

5. When your symptoms reduce and you ask your doctor if you can get off medications his answer is usually NO. This is  because he firmly believes that your chronic condition is incurable (that is what he was taught in the medical college), and the only reason your symptoms are lowered is because you are on medications. 

As we move on to discuss various diseases and medications you are going to face these problems. Already some members have written to me that they will ask their doctor about reducing medications. When you do that please go prepared with your ducks ( data) lined up. That is why in describing the objective of this group,  I specifically mention that “the goal is to empower it’s members to get off chronic medications by teaching them in active, PBWF diet and Intermittent Fasting lifestyle”.
