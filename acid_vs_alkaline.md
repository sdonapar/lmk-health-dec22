# ACIDIC vs ALKALINE

Human body prefers slight alkalinity. A Ph value of 7.0 indicates neutrality. Human body prefers to maintain blood at a level of 7.4 (7.35 - 7.45).
When we consume excessive amount of acidic food it can be harmful. 
Human body can regulate itâ€™s alkalinity automatically by changing the acidity of the urine. So it is important to make sure that your body remains hydrated. 
Human stomach has an acidity level of 3.5. So it is unlikely that one can become too alkaline by eating primarily alkaline food.

An acidic body implies that the diet consumed may be too acidic and/or lifestyle may be too sedentary. 

All animal foods including dairy are acidic. Also most refined foods; refined sugar, refined flour, refined oils are acidic. As a result most packaged foods you buy in grocery store are acidic. Coffee, Tea, Alcohol and tobacco are also acidic. 
Common symptoms  of acidic body are; Over weight, Sleep problems, Osteoporosis,
Sensitive Teeth etc. 
Acidic body is more prone to sickness, chronic diseases like cancer, CVD and aging.
Rather than taking some medicine, allopathic or natural, to bring down acidity, the focus should be on changing our diet. 

We must eliminate or reduce acidic foods from our diet and add alkaline foods to our diet. 
Plant based whole food diet will always keep acidity away from us and thereby keep diseases away from us.

Some simple natural ways that you can practice every day to alkalize your organism are:

1. Stop eating highly acidic foods. 
2. Eat lots of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. They are alkaline. 
3. Start your day with a large glass of water with the juice of a freshly-squeezed lemon and ginger (or Alovera or Aamla or apple cider vinegar).
4. Avoid eating foods with added sugar. Refined sugar is one of the worst acidic foods. Avoid all soft drinks and minimize alcohol consumption.
5. Add more sprouts to your daily diet. They are extremely alkalizing and rich in nutrients and energy-boosting enzymes.
6. Become physically active. Go for walks and try to complete a minimum of 10,000 steps every day.
