# Stomach Issues on PBWF

As you change your diet to a PBWF diet and specially green smoothies or juicing, you may experience some stomach issues. These would depend upon what was your previous diet and lifestyle. If your diet was deficient in fiber, you might experience changes in your bowl movement. Some of the signs and symptoms that you may be consuming too much fiber too quickly are: 

1. Excess fiber can cause constipation or diarrhea. Think of fiber as bulk that attracts water in the GI tract. If you don’t have enough fluid in your system, dehydration of the GI tract can occur, leading to hardening and difficulty passing the stools. This is especially common when the fiber is primarily soluble fiber. 
On the other hand excessive insoluble fiber can lead to diarrhea and loose stools. 
Although adding insoluble fiber to your diet can be a good treatment for constipation, too much consumption of insoluble fiber can lead to diarrhea and loose stools—especially if you increase your intake, all of a sudden, which will push the contents. 

2. BLOATING:
Consuming too much fiber can also create uncomfortable symptoms like bloating. 
This most often happens when you eat too much fiber too quickly because most of the fiber won’t be digested or broken down while moving through the GI tract. Bloating is also quite common when you consume smoothies as their is air mixed finely in the smoothies. 

3. GAS PROBLEMS
When we increase consumption of fiber it feeds the bacteria and other micro organisms in our microbiome in the colon. The bacteria feeds on the fiber and releases a gas by-product.

4. ABDOMINAL PAIN:
Along with the change in bowel movements, gas, and bloating, cramping can also occur with too much fiber. This results from too much fiber causing digestion to slow down or stop.

5. MINERAL DEFICIENCIES:
Fiber is a binding agent, meaning it can also bind to nutrients and cause them to be eliminated before the body has a chance to absorb them. This process most commonly affects iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and calcium absorption. According to some studies it may be possible to offset this by ensuring that you consume adequate amounts of vitamin C. 

## WHAT TO DO:
Generally stomach stabilizes within few days or weeks. If it persists you may be eating too much fiber, consuming it too quickly, consuming the wrong kind of fiber, or be in need of some extra vitamin C. I suggest you try the following:
* Try and find out what specific food is causing the problem and eliminate it. 
* Reduce the amount of juice and other fiber intake and increase it slowly.
* If you’re experiencing constipation, try switching to insoluble fiber. If you’re experiencing loose stools, try switching to soluble fiber.
* If you are experiencing constipation, ensure that you’re drinking enough water. 

## SKIN ISSUES
When people loose lot of fat, sometimes they may experience some skin issues like pimples. These also go away over time. Human body can hide away some toxins in fat and this fat is released to provide energy during ketosis, the toxins are released in the process and skin tries to get rid of them.

## HEADACHES 
Headache is a different matter. It is associated with the withdrawal symptoms. Food is also an addiction. Besides commonly known substances like caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, certain foods are also addictive. Some of the most addictive foods are:
1. Sugar
2. Cheese
3. Chocolate 
4. Potato chips and French fries
5. Ice cream 
6. Breakfast cereals 
7. Pizzas 
8. Biscuits and cakes

The two documentaries I suggested “Fat Sick and Nearly Dead” and “Super Juice Me” cover this in some detail. I hope all who have chosen to do juice fast have at least seen these documentaries.
