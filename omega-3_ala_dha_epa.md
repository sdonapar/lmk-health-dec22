# Omega-3:ALA, DHA, EPA‚Ä¢

Human body is good at converting all excess calories we consume into fat. Fat is a way for body to store enerhgy during periods of feasts so that we would have it available during periods of famine. Fat is found in all plant based foods. So consumption of 10-15% of total daily calories as fat is more than sufficient. There are three types of fats; 
1. Saturated Fats: All animal fats are saturated fats. Among plants, coconut and palm kernel are good examples.
2. Mono Unsaturated Fats: these are found in nuts, avocados, olives and mustard seeds
3. Polyunsaturated Fats: Omega-3 found in dark leafy greens, walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds and Omega-6 found in corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil and cotton seed oil etc. 

 Of all these fats there are only two fatty acids that our body can not make and they therefore are known as essential fatty acids. These are Omega-3 and Omega-6 and they need to be consumed daily. Besides these there really isn‚Äôt any essential fat. 
Omega fats are of three types; ALA, DHA and EPA. Plants are rich in ALA; animal food and specially fish is rich in DHA and EPA. 
Human body can convert ALA into DHA and EPA. Food sources like Flaxseed, Chiaseed, Walnuts etc. are good sources of Omega-3 and provide plenty of ALA. 
A question sometimes raised is that based on some studies it appears that this conversion by human body may not be sufficient and therefore DHA & EPA supplements should be taken regularly. Dr. Greger who reviews all medical and nutritional research papers has discussed this subject in great detail. I want to state that I do not agree with this argument for following reasons:
1. My whole premise about nutrition and health is that human body evolved over millions of years and knows how to handle food as long as we feed it natural food in whole form. Based on this rational I say that food supplements are not required and are often more harmful than helpful. The only exception Vitamin B-12 is because of chlorination of water in municipal supply which eliminates vitamin B-12. The argument that human body can not make enough DHA and EPA is inconsistent with this premise. 
2. There are many Giants in the field of PBWF and they do not always agree on some issues. Under those situations I have to make a call and pick one view over the other. I had discussed the issue of DHA and EPA with Dr. Collin Campbell and Dr. John McDougall three years ago and they both feel against taking these supplements. I quote below Dr. Collin Campbell. 

‚ÄúIf I must answer the DHA question, I would only say that we can get plenty of that type of chemical from the consumption of the omega-3 fatty acids that are found in certain plants‚Äìcertain nuts, flaxseed, etc. Indeed, it also is related to a dietary balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids and this balance can be readily met with a good quality diet of wholesome vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts.‚Äù
