# Protein Fat & Carbs

What and How much ?

I discussed earlier that there are only three macronutrients that provide calories for energy: Proteins, Fats and Carbs. So the question comes what should be consumed and how much. My purpose in this post is to clarify this confusion. 

PROTEINS:
We have already covered this in detail and established that one only needs 6% of the daily caloric value in protein and considering that all plant based whole foods have proteins so it is not a nutrient of concern. Hopefully you all have seen the Utube video entitled “Dangerous Truth About Protein”. If not you must do it now. 
US government had established over 70 years ago, that minimum requirement of protein in our diet is 5-6% (by calories) and recommended daily allowance is 8-10%. We also know that our body can not store protein as such and any access consumed protein burdens our liver and kidney to convert protein into fat and/or Carbohydrates and Uric  Acid.

FATS:
Our body is good at converting all excess calories we consume into Fat. It is a way for body to store energy during periods of fiests so that we would have it available during periods of famine.

There are three types of fats; 
1. Saturated (animal, coconut oil and palm kernel oil), 
2. Mono Unsaturated (nuts, avocados, olive oil and mustard oil) and 
3. Polyunsaturated: Omega-3 found in dark leafy greens, walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, mustard seeds and Omega-6 found in most vegetable oils (corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil cotton seed oil etc.). 

Our body converts all excess carbs and proteins into fat and stores in fat cells. There are only two fatty acids that our body can not make and they therefore are known as essential fatty acids. These are Omega-3 and Omega-6 and they need to be consumed daily. Besides these there really isn’t any essential fat. Fat is found in all plant based foods. So consumption of 10-15% fat is more than sufficient. 

Omega-3/Omega-6 Ratio:
As there are limited sources of Omega-3, human body has preference for it and even if your food has a higher ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 the body absorbs them in required amounts. The problem comes when our food has disproportionately high amounts of omega-6. This happens when we start consuming most vegetable oils with the exception of mustard oil, canola oil and ghee. 
In PBWF the consumption of oil is discouraged as it is not whole food; the fiber has been removed. If one is ill with any chronic illness and wants to reverse it then one must follow the recommendations of PBWF to a T and avoid oil altogether. For those who are otherwise healthy (meaning not on any medication) I suggest you can make an exception and consume two teaspoons of oil and/or ghee per day. 
To ensure that one is getting enough Omega-3 one must consume five walnuts and one tablespoon of Flaxseed and/or Chiaseed every day.

CARBS:
The energy our body needs is for two functions; one to keep our brain and other organs  functioning and second for physical activity. Human brain alone, consumes almost half the daily caloric requirement. Brain uses glucose. So you can see that bulk of our caloric requirement has to come from Carbohydrates. All carbs need to be consumed in natural form which is complex carbohydrates. All five categories of food that we need to consume are :    
      1. Fruits
      2. Vegetables
      3. Grains
      4.Beans & Daals
      5. Nuts & Seeds
With the exception of nuts and seeds, all these foods are rich in Carbs. The problem comes when we start eating refined foods. Unfortunately the Food Industry that wants you to eat meat, dairy, poultry, fish and eggs have maligned the Carbs and they give examples of sugar, white flour, soft drinks, Canned juices, potato chips, cookies, cakes, bread and all the other processed foods, which shouldn’t be eaten any way. They are not food. They are food like products. 
There is lot of money riding on this. Processed food industry along with Meet, Dairy Poultry and Fisheries Industries deliberately confuse you to eat low carbs and more of their products. They fund research that deliberately confuses you. More than 94 percent of research today is funded by food industry. They fund writers to write books or buy the books which serve there interest, making them best sellers. The Grain Brain and Wheat Belly are books that deliberately confuse you. Do not fall into their trap.
