# FIBER AS NUTRIENT

Fiber as an important nutrient was recognized much later than most other nutrients. Dr. Burkitt was the first to emphasize it‚Äôs importance in a book titled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Forget Fiber in Your Diet‚Äù published in 1979.
For many years fiber was thought only to improve your bowl movement and satiety. Both of which are true but latest research has brought many more important benefits to our attention. 
There are two types of fiber; soluble and insoluble. The two comments above are true for insoluble fiber. 
The microbes in our gut microbiome feed on fiber to produce metabolites which help protect us from high BP and in many other ways. Active research is on going in this field. 
Soluble fiber helps reduce blood glucose levels and thereby reduces the risk of diabetes. Some of the other  benefits are:
‚Ä¢ control body weight
‚Ä¢ control and possibly prevent hypertension
‚Ä¢ help balance cholesterol levels in blood
‚Ä¢ regulate bowel movements and prevent hemorrhoids
‚Ä¢ regulate your body‚Äôs satiation signals, which let you know when you‚Äôre full
‚Ä¢ lower risk of colon cancer
‚Ä¢ lower risk of breast cancer
‚Ä¢ require more chewing, which slows down your meals and aids digestion.
