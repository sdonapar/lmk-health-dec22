# Politics of Health

Having covered the five pillars of health, we will now move on to discuss Chronic Diseases. But before I do that, I want to discuss various factors that come into play as far as our understanding of health is concerned. These have to do with the perceptions we carry as a result of information being fed to us by the research labs at Pharma, food and health care industries and government and media. During this week we will cover following:
1. What is Normal?
2. Placebo & Nocebo Effects
3. Modern vs Alternate Medicine
4. Bias in Research
- Funding Bias
- Researcher’s Personal Bias 
- Negative Outcome Bias
- Publication Bias
- Statistical Manipulation
5. Side Effects and ADRs. Confessions of a Pharma Exec. 
6. Nexus of Industries, Govt and Media.

The documentaries specifically related to this subject are “What The Health” and “Death by Medicine”. Please watch them if you haven’t already.
