# 2.5 Everything in Moderation
Even Disease

There is a popular myth that says eat everything in moderation. The problem with this is that 
eating in moderation gives diseases also in moderation. Moderate diseases like BP, mild arthritis, mild asthama, mild diabetes etc.; lot of diseases we take for granted as signs of old age. Eating more gives you serious illnesses like heart attack, cancer, COPD, Kidney and Liver diseases. 
When we follow the PBWF guidelines strictly we experience a life without any old age disease. Your BP comes down to 120/75, you suddenly feel you have more energy at 70 than you had at 30. One of the most common feed back I get is that people stop getting tired. I had started running at the age of 28 but maximum I had ever jogged was 12 miles at the age 31 before I came down with Cancer. 
In 2018 to my surprise I found that I could do half marathon (13.1 mile jogging not running). 
There are certain diets which make you age at the chronological rate, there are others which age you less than chronological rate but PBWF/IF regimen actually helps reverse your age. By that I mean it ofsetts the excessive aging you may have experienced in earlier part of your life due to poor diet and lifestyle. It truly is amazing.
