# DAILY MEAL PLAN

A question, that is often asked is to outline a daily meal plan. Many people get confused about what to eat when. In my guidelines, unlike some other dietary programs, there is complete freedom to choose foods (as long as they are plant based whole foods and eaten within a narrow eating window). By consuming green juice fruits and nuts & seeds, you already take care of the three food groups. Typically,  a breakfast takes care of these three food groups, so you have total flexibility in what to eat for lunch or dinner. 

Here is a guideline for a daily meal plan on PBWF. It assumes that your eating window is 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. For a different eating window you can adjust accordingly. 

## BREAKFAST
10:00 AM: A glass of green juice
10:20 AM: A large bowl of fresh fruits and berries
10:30AM: Oatmeal or Dalia or Idli or whatever, as long as it is PBWF. (This can be skipped also and eaten with lunch; it is your choice)

## LUNCH
1:00 PM: A glass of green juice 
1:20 PM: Lunch: Whatever you feel like, made with grains and beans or legumes and/or starchy vegetables as long as it is PBWF. 

## SNACK (Optional)
4:00 PM: Tea or coffee or fruits or dry fruits

## DINNER
5:10 PM: A glass of green juice
5:30 to 6:00 PM: Dinner: Whatever you feel like as long as it is PBWF. 

The second and third glass of juice can be eliminated once you are off all medications. 
Make sure you are getting your minimum daily requirement of Flax/Chia seeds and walnuts. More is better. Also take Vitamin B-12 supplement with any meal. 

Please note there is total flexibility for the meal menu. Any grains, any beans or legumes and any starchy vegetables are fine. You can make anything out of dosa batter (takes care of two food groups: daal & rice). You can even eat boiled, baked or hash brown potatoes or sweet potatoes. In the long run your body will guide you by making you feel like eating one thing or the other. You can not go wrong, if you listen to your body after 6 months on PBWF (not today, it probably has some unhealthy habits that need to be overcome first). It is a good idea to include salad in your meal. You can skip the glass of green juice if you are having salad with a meal.
