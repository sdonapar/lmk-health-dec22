# PBWF in New York City

I am pleased to share with you the news that New York City has decided to train its doctors in a plant based nutrition training beginning next year. This is the first of its kind program in the Western World. 
This will allow doctors to, where appropriate, suggest a switch to animal-free foods for potential health gains for their patients.
