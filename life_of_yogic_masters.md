# Life of Yogic Masters

In all my health groups, at some point or other a discussion about  the merits of our rich cultural heritage of yoga, pranayama and meditation comes up. Add to that the undisputed nutritional richness of our spices. One would expect that our yoga and spiritual masters must have lived a long and healthy life. Generally this discussion comes up on account of my criticism of dairy and ghee. So I decided to research the life of yoga masters of the last 150 years and found that, of the sixteen masters, the life span ranged from 39 to 100 years. The average life span was 78 years and the median was 77.5 years. Even if we exclude the two extremes, for the remaining 14 the average was 79.2 years. 
Here is the raw data. I was fortunate to be blessed by three of them and I have cooked for two of them many meals. 

1.Mahavtara Babaji: 74
2.Vivekananda: 39
3.Shivananda: 76
4.Ramana Maharshi: 71
5.Kuvalyananda: 82
6.T. Krishnamacharya100
7.ParmhansYogananda59
8.Anandmayi Ma: 86
9.Dhirendr Brahmchari70
10.Mahesh Yogi: 90
11.BKS Iyangar: 96
12.Patabhi Joyce: 94
13.TKV Desikachar: 78

So the question that comes to mind is why the life of these yogic masters is about the same as an average American who has unhealthy diet and lifestyle. Also when we compare to people living in various Blue Zones around the world, the life expectancy of yogic masters, falls way short. This is inspite of the fact that people in the Blue Zones neither do Yoga, Pranayama, Meditation nor have the rich spices in their diet. 
It is my belief that somehow our ancestors made a mistake on the issue of milk, dairy, ghee and oil. If these yogic masters had excluded dairy and refined oils they might have lived another 10-20 years. 

I meet many people in India who are on chronic medications and they tell me that they have started doing yoga and pranayam. Yoga, Pranayam and Meditation are all good practices and I practice them myself and recommend strongly but to reverse chronic diseases, you have to stop eating foods that are causing the disease in the first place.
