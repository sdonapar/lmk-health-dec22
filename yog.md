# YOG

What is YOG? 
Yog means to join. What are we trying to join?
One way to look at ourselves is to realize that we are a bundle of Body, Mind and Intellect (BMI). With body we perceive the world of objects around us, with mind we feel the the world of emotions around us and with intellect we think in the world of thoughts (ideologies) around us. So we the Perceiver, Feeler, Thinker (PFT) equipped with our Body, Mind and Intellect (BMI) is constantly seeking Happiness in the world of Objects, Emotions and Thoughts (OET) around us. Very often these three pursuits for happiness are at conflict with each other. The body wants to pursue one thing the mind other, and the intellect has some totally different idea. 
To give a simple example it is late night you are watching a great movie, that is coming on the TV that you had been wanting to see for a very long time, and you have an important meeting tomorrow morning at the office. The body is tired and wants to go to sleep, the mind wants to watch the movie and Intellect is saying don’t be ridiculous you have an important meeting in the morning. 
In our pursuit for happiness we face such conflicts all the time. Conflicts within our own body mind and intellect. In teenage years we mistakenly confuse physical attraction to love or in adulthood, fall in love with a neighbors wife knowing very well in our intellect that this is inappropriate and will lead to unhappy endings. 
Most smokers know that smoking is bad but cave in to body’s desire to smoke. The same with alcohol drinkers and those addicted to chocolates, cheese or Mithai. 
So one goal towards happiness is to bring our own Body, Mind and Intellect into sync so that internal conflicts go away. 
THIS IS YOG. 

We all are seeking happiness but interestingly enough what we are seeking is different for each one of us. The one is seeking cigarettes the other hates cigarette. The scotch drinker while walking through the airport terminal gets attracted to various scotches on the display but his wife has no interest in them and is attracted to the perfume counter where all the finest perfumes are on display. Why is it so ? 
Our Sages in our scriptures tell us that this is so because of our interactions in the earlier years of life. If as a teenager, trying to belong to a clique of smokers you caved in to smoking, you have developed that addiction. If the group you were exposed to was of alcohol drinkers you developed addiction to alcohol. The same applies to Marijuana smokers or cocaine users. The term used to define these is Vasanas. The way we interact in the world around us, we develop impressions which lead to such desires. These desires are always dictating our actions and our mind is constantly flooded with thoughts. Thoughts about subtle desires, which we feel, if fulfilled, will be the source of happiness. Clearly the object, emotion or thought that we are seeking does not carry with it the happiness. If it was so, everyone would experience it, but they don’t. So the Scriptures tell us that, it is our personality that has embedded in it the happiness code. Our true nature is happiness. Pure consciousness in us is blissful. We are unable to experience it because of the cover of Vasanas that we have accumulated during our lifespan to date. When we act in this world with an egocentric desire we accumulate more desires. When we act in this world without any egocentric desires we feel bliss. 

Water drops flow towards water to merge with it. Mercury droplets are in a hurry to merge with other droplets. It is in our nature to seek our true selves. The consciousness in us is seeking to merge into pure consciousness (jeevatma and Parmatma) the universal consciousness. 

BRINGING THESE TOGETER IS YOG. 

Doing Yog asanas is one of eight steps in achieving this. Patanjali called this pursuit Ashtang Yoga. 
The eight steps are 
1. Yam
2. Niyam
3. Yogasanas
4. Pranayama
5. Pratyahara 
6. Dharna
7. Dhyana 
8. Samadhi
As we practice Yog, we should keep in mind that we must strive to practice all the first six limbs of Yog each day of our life. I say six steps because step 7 and 8 can not be consciously practiced. They happen when you succeed in the first six steps . Dharna leads to Dhyan and Dhyan leads to Samadhi.
