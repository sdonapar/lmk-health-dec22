# How Do I Get Calcium?

After discussion about milk the following question always is ‚Äúhow do I get my calcium?‚Äù This is one of the most frequently asked questions I face. Even though it is covered in the very first documentary I recommend ‚ÄúForks over Knives‚Äù and the second video by Dr Janice Stranger about the food myths. The two reasons for this question are that it is ingrained in our mind that calcium is needed for strong bones and secondly that milk is the best source of calcium. Both of which are incorrect. 
The bones do not become strong by eating calcium. Calcium is actually very brittle as any body who has ever used a chalk to write on a black board would know. Bones are made of collagen which are fibrous proteins comprising a honeycomb structure, and an inorganic bone mineral in the form of small crystals. The strength in bones comes from putting stress on this honeycomb structure which we do when we exercise. The more stress we put on the bones the stronger they become. 
Milk is not the best source of calcium. On the contrary milk is acidic in nature like all animal foods and causes acidosis. To neutralize this acid the calcium in the body is utilized and this leads to depletion of calcium. Osteoporosis is most common among the countries that consume most dairy. These include US, Canada, Denmark and Sweden. The best sources of calcium are green leafy vegetables. Here are some videos worth watching that deal with the subject. üëá
