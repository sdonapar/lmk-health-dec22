# Prebiotics & Probiotics

Human body has 30 trillion cells and it hosts another 38 trillion micro cells mostly in our lower Gastrointestinal track. These comprise of bacteria, virus, fungi and other microbes. Collectively called microbiome, these foreign cells play a major role in human health and in last two decades we have learned a lot about them. These microbes also require nourishment and fiber is very important for them. Foods that feed these cells are called prebiotic and food that contain such cells are called probiotic. 
When we take antibiotic drugs they kill bad bacterial infection, many healthy bacteria are also killed. 

Pre-biotics serve as food for our microbiota. What we eat feeds our intestinal flora and, when we eat plant based whole foods, they thrive. Prebiotic foods serve as the energy source for these microbes to multiply & thrive and in turn do some amazing things in our bodies!

While all fiber acts as a prebiotic, there are some foods that are especially useful. When our microbes encounter fiber, they ferment them into molecules called short chain fatty acids like butyrate, acetate & propionate which are very beneficial. 

These short chain fatty acids are the primary energy source for the cells that line the inside of the colon & aid in the regulation of several processes within our body including, 
* Protecting the mucous layer lining the gut
* Fat deposition 
* Inflammation 
* Immune system & regulation of Tcell production
* Cancer suppression

If one is struggling with digestive issues, consuming some probiotics foods can help. Specially after a course of antibiotic drugs. Here are some healthy foods rich in probiotics:

* Sauerkraut
* Kimchi
* Pickled Vegetables 
* Kombucha
* Tempeh
* Sourdough Bread
* Miso as in Miso Soup

Please note that most people on PBWF diet are getting enough Prebiotics and need not worry about probiotics at all.
