# Intermittent Fasting - SIDE  EFFECTS 

When one starts Intermittent Fasting some people are able to jump right into it very easily but others face some difficulties. Most side effects are temporary and due to adaptive process of the body. These go away within few days. If you experience hunger and are unable to keep a longer fasting window of 16 hours; it is a good idea to expand your fasting window slowly by one hour each week.
Here are some common side effects of Intermittent Fasting:

1. Headache, dizziness, mental fog and feeling a little sluggish. These are withdrawal symptoms because most people are addicted to food and when denied, they experience such withdrawal symptom. One reason for feeling this way is electrolyte imbalance. In the absence of salt, that comes from food, body looses water impacting the electrolyte balance. It is a good idea to drink water with some Himalayan salt and lemon juice mixed in. 

2. Mood Swings: Just another withdrawal symptom. 

3. Upon breaking fast one may feel bloated specially if you eat too much food. too quickly. 

4. Feeling nauseated when you eat. It may be due to sluggish liver and gall bladder and adaptive response of the body. Having ginger tea can help. This should go away within a few weeks. 

5. Experiencing Diarrhea: When we burn fat during ketosis, the fat cells also release some toxins which were stored in the fat cells over time. Human body has a defense mechanism called PPRAY pathway by which toxins are stored in the fat cells. These released toxins can cause diarrhea and be excreted. Taking a tablespoon of Psyllium husk in the morning can help with diarrhea. 

6. Acid Reflux: Take fresh lemon or lime juice and/or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with warm water in the morning. 

7. Feeling Cold: Again a temporary affect and goes away in few weeks. 

8. Insomnia: When we fast body experiences stress and produces counter regulatory hormones like Cortisol, Epinephrine, Noradrenaline, Glucagon and human growth hormones. This is bodyâ€™s way of telling you to go search for food (instead of sleeping).

9. Hair Loss: This generally happens if you were deficient of nutrients in the first place. It is also temporary. Hair should grow back and better. 

10. Bad Breadth: This again is due to toxins released with fat. It is a temporary phenomenon and should go away once weight stabilizes. 

All side effects discussed above are due to adaptive response of the body and generally go away within a month or two. There are some other side effects which have more to do with the weight loss which involves fat burning. These can happen even after few months and one should be aware of them. 

1. Gout Pain: When we have high levels of inflammation, the body produces uric acid,  (which is actually an antioxidant) to deal with it. So fasting can spike uric acid in some people. If you are experiencing that, do the following: (1) reduce your fruit consumption (2) eliminate alcohol (3)avoid sugar.

2. Dr. Jason Fung mentions that there is some evidence that suggests that IF can  cause gall bladder stones. It is quite rare. Consumption of green juice should avoid this problem.
