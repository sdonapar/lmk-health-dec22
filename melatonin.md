# MELATONIN

Melatonin is a very important hormone and human body makes it in pineal gland. Recent studies have also shown that it is made in the gut from the enterochromaffin cells. 
Generally it is released after sunset. For a long time it was perceived only as sleep hormone but new research is pointing out that it has many more functions and plays a critical role in rejuvenation of the body after a long day of activity. 

There are two types of melatonin. One that is part of blood circulatory system. It is made in the pineal gland which gets stimulated with darkness. The other melatonin is sub cellular as it is inside the mitochondria (organelles inside all cells). It is there to protect against massive oxidation and free radical damage that occurs in mitochondria. 
The latest research suggests that melatonin in pineal gland is only as a backup to sub cellular melatonin. If there is not enough melatonin in body, it affects sleep, inflammation and antioxidant protection. Lack of melatonin also affects chronic degenerative diseases like hypertension, diabetes and brain diseases. There is a condition called Sundown Syndrome among dementia and Alzheimer’s patients. When sun goes down about 45% of dementia and Alzheimer’s patients start getting agitated fatigued. This is due to shortage of melatonin. 

Darkness and infrared light promote production of melatonin Brightness and blue light work opposite. The recent research has shown that largest stimulant of subcellular melatonin is near infrared (NIR) waves of the sun. About 50% of the sun’s energy is infrared. Historically wooden fires also provided infrared exposure. Incandescent light is also a source of infrared radiation however these are getting replaced with fluorescent lights. Infrared rays are also reflected by clouds and grass so being outdoors, even without sun, is also beneficial. 

Besides antioxidant and anti inflammatory benefits melatonin is beneficial in many other ways as outlined below:
1. It is an immune modulator as it is very powerful against certain viruses. 
2. It is neuroprotective and helps memory and relieves anxiety and depression.
3. Melatonin controls the timing and release of reproductive hormones both in men and women. 
4. Melatonin has cardio protective qualities. It helps lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol profile. 
5. Melatonin is critical in making, secreting and actions of insulin. The action of melatonin regulates the expression of Glucose Type-4 (GLUT4). This triggers the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. So reduction of melatonin can lead to increase in insulin resistance. 
6. Research has shown that women who have breast cancer often have lower levels of melatonin. The same is true with men with prostate cancger. 

As human body makes melatonin, it is not an essential nutrient but it’s production does go down as we age. I do not advise taking melatonin supplements. Melatonin was discovered in plant foods in 1995 and their are several foods that are rich in melatonin. These include pistachios, cranberries, mushrooms, cherries and walnuts, which should be consumed as a regular part of diet any way. One only needs to eat two pistachios every day to get enough melatonin. I have always recommended date-pistachio roll as dessert after dinner. 

My purpose in this post is  to emphasize how important Circadian Rhythm is and why we must finish our dinner three hours before bedtime and stop watching TV and computer screens few hours before bedtime. Every one must set their cellphones to switch on blue light filter after 8:00 PM.
