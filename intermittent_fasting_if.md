# Intermittent Fasting (IF)

Human  body evolved over millions of years eating mostly fruits and vegetables with some beans, cereals, nuts and seeds. Another observation about our evolution is that we finished our dinners by sunset and next morning we went in search of food, to return by late morning or early afternoon and prepared our lunch. The gap between the two meals was any where from 12-16 hours. It is only in last 10,000 years, when we settled down and started farming and keeping animals for milk and meat, that food became readily available to have morning breakfast. Prior to these 10,000 years, we faced periods of feasts and famine regularly. The result is that our body evolved to store surplus food in the form of fat in our fat cells. The number of fat cells stop increasing after certain age but each cell has almost unlimited capacity to store fat. Human body is very efficient in converting carbohydrates into fat and this is happening all the time. However the conversion of fat into energy, which again is a straight forward process, does not happen as easily any more. The reason for this is that we do not face any periods of famine any more. This is, as if, our body has forgotten how to burn fat to produce energy. 
This happens because, before we can burn all the calories from the previous meal, we eat another meal, that supplies fresh batch of calories. Many of us eat five meals a day; bed tea/coffee, breakfast, lunch, evening tea/coffee and dinner. Some take additional snacks in between or snacks with evening alcohol or a glass of milk before bedtime. The result is that our pancreas are releasing insulin all the time and the only rest they get is for 8 hours during sleep. This constant presence of insulin in our body from 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 at night leads to many chronic problems which we will discuss later but for now please understand the presence of insulin interferes with the ability to burn fat. 

Many of us incorrectly believe that during fasting the body must be slowing down the metabolic rate but the reverse is true. When body burns fat it produces ketones and the brain functions very well with ketones. The process is called Ketosis and during ketosis, when brain receives ketones, instead of glucose, it realizes that there is food shortage. The brain thereby increases the metabolic rate to sharpen the body and mind, as if it is telling you to go out and search for food. 
I highly recommended all to compress your eating window from 16 hours to a shorter period and increase the fasting window to a longer period. This concept is called Chauvihar in the Indian Jain community and “Intermittent Fasting” in the modern scientific community (also called “Time Restricted Feeding”). In addition, it helps the body heal better and develop better immunity when we subject it to periods of famine by fasting for a period of 16 hours or longer.

The concepts of  intermittent fasting (IF) and extended fasting have gained momentum in the western world only recently but it has been practiced in the East for thousands of years.
Based on research on mice, we have known for over six decades that regular fasting improves health and increases life expectancy by up to 50% in mice. However the reasons for this were not clear. The Nobel prizes in physiology in 2016 and 2018 have been awarded for research on this subject and now we understand the reasons also. 
The other terms used to describe the practice of IF are “Reduced Eating Window” or “Time Restricted Feeding”. The goal in intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window to as narrow as possible. The ultimate in intermittent fasting is “One Meal A Day” (OMAD) plan; when your fasting window becomes 23 hours. Many Indian spiritual masters practice this. 

In intermittent fasting the idea is to finish your dinner early and delay your first caloric meal of the morning, so that the eating window can be narrowed to 8 hours or less. This helps in two main ways: 
(1) Firstly it gets the body used to the idea of burning fat to produce energy in the form of ketones. This increases the metabolic rate and thereby helps loose fat. 
(2) Secondly it promotes autophagy which has many detoxing benefits and builds immunity. Autophagy was first discovered by Belgian biochemist Dr. Christian De Duve,  who received a Nobel prize for his discovery in 1974. He discovered that every cell has a kind of recycling department called lysosome which is like the stomach of the cell having enzymes that can help recycle wasted protein into amino acids. Lysosome stores worn out or damaged tissues, food particles, bacteria, viruses and other junk that accumulates in the cells. Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi discovered that during fasting, the body is under stress and no new protein (amino acids) is available. At that time Lysosome decomposes waste proteins into amino acids which can be used to make new cells. 

During the fasting period it is best to avoid all beverages except plain water. Some doctors allow consumption of any beverage which do not have any calories eg. black coffee or tea or plain water with lemon, ginger, turmeric, or amla extract etc. There are mixed views on it. If your goal is only to lose weight and your caffeine addictions doesn’t allow keeping longer fasting windows with out caffeine consumption that it may be okay to consume black coffee or tea without sugar but if possible please avoid anything but water. 

Intermittent fasting can be started slowly by first observing a 12 hour fasting window and then increasing it to 14 hrs. and 16hrs. or more. 
There are other ways to do intermittent fasting called 5/2 or alternate day method where you reduce your meal to a low calorie (under 500 calories) on two days in a week or every alternate day. I do not recommend these approaches as your body’s circadian rhythm never gets used to the pattern and on fasting days you do feel hungry. In 16:8 pattern, within three weeks, your circadian rhythm takes over and you don’t feel hungry in the morning. 

Walking or exercising during the fasting window enhances the effect of IF. One mile walk is equivalent to one additional hour of fasting. Therefore it helps to do your exercises during the fasting window. 

When we eat frequently and for longer periods, our blood sugar stays elevated for longer than normal. This is because insulin can’t efficiently clear it – this leads to the formation of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). This process accelerates aging by triggering inflammation, neuropathy, fine lines and wrinkles and much more.
The health benefits of intermittent fasting include following:
1. Reduction in fat mass
2. Increased insulin sensitivity 
3. Lower inflammation 
4. Improved heart function
5. Increased mitochondrial volume
6. Improved body repair processes
7. Aerobic endurance improvements. 

NOT FOR EVERYONE 
Intermittent fasting is not for everyone and following groups should avoid fasting window longer than 12 hours. 
1. Pregnant Women
2. Children under 16
3. People with eating disorders like bulimia
4. People with gall bladder issues. 

IF  SCORE   
There is a way to monitor your IF progress by computing your intermittent fasting score and tracking it.
• IF score is calculated weekly. 
• Compute the time gap between you last caloric food intake in the evening and the first caloric food intake of the morning (in hours).
• Add to this total miles walked or equivalent exercise, during this period (after dinner and before breakfast). This is your score for the day.
• Now add this score for the 7 days of the week and grade your self based on the following criteria:

A.  Over 140   Excellent 
B.  120-140    Very Good
C.  100-120   Good
D.   80-100     Fair
F.  Under 80   Poor
