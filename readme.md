#### What I will be recommending in this group is latest scientific evidence based recommendations. Some of my recommendations clash with long held beliefs of many. Many Christian‚Äôs believe that God made animals for their consumption and not eating animals would somehow offend their God. Jains believe that eating underground vegetables is against their faith. I want to make it very clear that it is not my intention to offend any group. üôè

Please understand that in my recommendations you are allowed nut or seed butters (pastes). These should be added after you have saut√©ed the onions in vegetable stock or water. After adding nut butters, you can add all spices. It is best to first add all spices in a cup and add some water and mix them then pour in the cookware over saut√©ed onions and nut butters while stirring constantly. After that follow your normal procedure. All dishes will come out perfect including Pulao and Khichri.
The only dishes not possible this way are the deep fried ones but for them you can use the air fryers. 
Here is a video that shows how to make nut or seed butters.

Please understand that paste made from any nuts or seeds (often called as butter like peanut butter, cashew butter, almond butter etc. are allowed and can be added to food preparations in place of oil or ghee). 
Except for deep fried dishes, you should not have any problem in cooking. Here is a video on how to make nut and seed butters.üëá
