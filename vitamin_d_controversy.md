# Vitamin D Controversy

Vitamin D is most marketed oversold myth of modern era. 
There is some debate as to what is a required level of Vitamin D. 
The Endocrine Society defines vitamin D deficiency as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood level below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/liter) and vitamin D insufficiency as a level between 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/liter).(Sep 22, 2016)
However many doctors in the Plant Based Whole Food Movement consider these recommendations to be arbitrarily too high and recommend that the recommended level should be 20ng/ml instead of 30 ng/ml.
