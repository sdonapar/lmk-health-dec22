# COFFEE DURING FAST?

An often asked question is whether drinking black coffee is okay during fasting periods. Many doctors do allow black coffee and I also have in the past allowed this exception. Part of the reason is that people are so dependent on coffee for their bowl movement that without it they can’t extend their eating window for proper adherence to 16:8 intermittent fasting. Also caffeine addiction causes headache withdrawal symptom making it difficult to fast. I want to address this issue today and revise my recommendation. 
Drinking coffee empty stomach is not a good idea as it can cause many problems. Here are some explanations:
(1) Even though black coffee doesn’t have any calories and should not interrupt ketosis during fasting window, it does reset the circadian clock. So for daily 16:8 intermittent fasting it should not be consumed during fasting window. 
(2) One objective of fasting is to provide complete rest to the digestive system and secretive glands. Drinking coffee interrupts this and gets the glands to secrete hormones and digestive fluids. If causes liver to release sugar. These disrupt the rejuvenation process. It is also true with the consumption of other additives like lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, Methi seeds, Amla extract etc. I suggest you avoid adding anything to your water during fasts. 
(3) Stomach has hydrochloric acid which helps digest food. Drinking coffee empty stomach increases acidity. This can lead to heartburn, acid reflux, irritable bowl syndrome and stomach ulcers. 
(4) Caffeine on empty stomach releases cortisol and adrenal hormones raising heart rate and blood pressure. This gives signal to liver to release blood sugar to assist in fight or flight response. This is the reason you feel perked up, but in the long run it is unhealthy as it interferes with your natural circadian rhythm. 
(5) Caffeine in Coffee leads to anxiety because you lower your brain’s power to properly breakdown serotonin which is the hormone that keeps you calm and  happy. It can also lead to depression. 
(6) Reduced serotonin production can affect sleep because body changes serotonin into melatonin at night. This is why coffee impacts one’s ability to sleep at night. 
(7) Coffee is diuretic and increases the amount of fluid the body passes which can lead to dehydration. 

For all these reasons it is advisable to drink coffee during your eating window with breakfast or lunch. One should avoid coffee after 4:00 PM as it has a half life of 6 hours and it might affect your sleep. Most things discussed in this post also apply to tea but to a somewhat lower extent. 

PLEASE AVOID COFFEE DURING ALL FASTS AND DAILY FASTING WINDOW.
