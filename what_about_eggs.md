# What About Eggs?

A frequently asked questions is about eating eggs. Many vegetarians eat egg because these are not fertilized and one is causing no harm to any animal. 

I had written in the very beginning that there are many reasons for being PBWF and one of them is religious; Ahimsa principle of non-violence towards animals. Though, that is not my primary reason in this group but I do encourage you all to watch the many documentaries that show how poultry farms treat their chickens. Once you see them you would never eat eggs or chicken. I will focus in this post only on the merits of health. Following are the reasons for avoiding eggs for health reasons:

1. Egg protein is rich in IGF-1 (Insulin like Growth Factor-1) hormone. This hormone causes rapid growth in blood vessel formation called Angiogenesis. This, in the presence of carcinogens (which are everywhere around us in todayâ€™s world) causes cancer cells to grow into tumors. 

2. Eggs have no fibers and fat in eggs is mostly saturated. This makes eggs inflammatory and that fat causes insulin resistance which leads to diabetes and other diseases. 

3. Eggs are very high in bad cholesterols and even half egg exceeds daily recommendation for cholesterol. 

4. The conditions in which chicken are kept are not very hygienic making eggs not very safe and can lead to many infectious diseases.
