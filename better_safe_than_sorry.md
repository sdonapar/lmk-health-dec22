# 2.6 Better Safe Than Sorry 

What does this mean to you? One of the most common myths is the myth about “better safe than sorry”. 
Many people believe that it is safer to continue taking some medications then to experience an occasional elevated BP or blood sugar or blood cholesterol reading. 

WHAT IF THE REVERSE WAS TRUE?

All the evidence we have today and specially about the politics of PHARMA, FOOD and HEALTH CARE industries, and the GOVERNMENT and MEDIA, points to the contrary. 
This thinking is old and flawed and there is a trend among progressive doctors that we have overdone on use of medications and on specializations, creating a tunnel vision with a total disregard for quality of life and all cause mortality. 

Human body is very smart and knows how to cope with the diet and lifestyle, it is subjected to. These raised levels of BP or blood sugar or cholesterol markers are result of body’s comypensatory response. 
What body does not know is how to deal with those synthetic medications. They are foreign to the body and interfere with body’s compensatory mechanisms. Besides they have to be processed by the liver and the kidney and strain them in ways not fully understood. 
So if you want to “be safe than sorry”, then you are better off letting the body do it’s job and raise those markers as and when necessary, while you focus on correcting the diet and lifestyle. We will discuss later how the cutoff points for prescribing medications are being revised to reduce over medication.
