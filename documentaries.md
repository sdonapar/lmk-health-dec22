# Documentaries

During the last week while we were waiting for the discussion to start, I had recommended that certain documentaries be watched. Some of you who joined late might have missed that post. My interest in PBWF started after watching a documentary on Neflix on January 1st 2013, “Forks over Knives”. I require all members to watch this documentary. Most documentaries are available on subscriptions sites like Netflix or Amazon Prime or on YouTube. Some are free and others you may have to rent. Here is a list of 10 documentaries I recommend. You can watch them at your convenience but please watch Forks over Knives ASAP.

The documentary “Forks over Knives” is a required viewing for this group. Dr. Colin Campbell’s explains in this documentary how he changed the direction of his research work after coming across a paper published by two Indian scientists Padambhushan Dr. Gopalan and Dr. Madhawan in 1968. Their research showed that excessive consumption of milk protein creates an environment which is conducive to cancer promotion. 
This came as a shock to Dr. Colin Campbell, as his life’s work to that date, was based on totally opposite premise, that animal protein is healthy for humans. 
Dr. Campbell replicated the work of Gopalan and Madhawan and found it to be correct. He dedicated his life to research on cow’s milk. His conclusive research shows that if this protein is consumed in excess (when total protein in diet is over 8% from all sources) it is harmful to health but if consumed in amounts less than 8%, it is beneficial. These research findings come as a surprise to me. Could this be the reason why Yashodha Ma kept milk products away from Lord Krishna’s reach. How did our ancestors know these things. It never ceases to amaze me. 
As humans have evolved over millions of years, food was never as plentiful as it is today and our diets have become rich in protein and most people are eating diets excessively rich in protein. In these circumstances it is difficult to justify the beneficial effects of dairy over the harm it might do. Besides the risk of cancer identified by Dr. Colin Campbell, consuming dairy products can have the unwanted health effect of increasing your LDL cholesterol levels also.
