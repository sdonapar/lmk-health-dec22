# Documentaries

During the last week while we were waiting for the discussion to start, I had recommended that certain documentaries be watched. Some of you who joined late might have missed that post. My interest in PBWF started after watching a documentary on Neflix on January 1st 2013, “Forks over Knives”. I require all members to watch this documentary. Most documentaries are available on subscriptions sites like Netflix or Amazon Prime or on YouTube. Some are free and others you may have to rent. Here is a list of 10 documentaries I recommend. You can watch them at your convenience but please watch Forks over Knives ASAP.
