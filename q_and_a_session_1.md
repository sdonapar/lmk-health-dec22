# Q&A Session # 1

Here are some responses to frequently asked questions at this stage. 

1. If you are on medications that require taking them with meals, take them with your first meal, whatever time you take that first meal. 

2. You can eat as much or as little you feel like. Rely on your body’s signals. **But eat all within a narrow eating window of 8-10 daytime hours**. Rule of thumb is 20% of your calories from each food group. If you want to lose weight faster than reduce the amount from nuts&seeds group and increase from green vegetables group. No artificial limits are necessary on nuts & seeds or any other food group. You should follow your body’s signals. When you eat unprocessed food body’s signals work well. They fail when you eat processed foods. One  must start listening to his body (after few months on PBWF when body has been tuned back to good health). Our body is very sophisticated and knows what things to consume in what combination. It’s satiation mechanism tells you when to stop eating. It’s nutrient deficiency signaling mechanism guides you to right foods for you. The processed food is designed by PhDs in psychology who know how to circumvent body’s satiation mechanism and make you want to eat something to the point of sickness and beyond. A good example is Pringle potato chips. In fact they take pride in the fact that you can’t stop at one and use that as their advertising slogan. It is true. It is best to avoid such foods altogether and not even taste. Once I decided to eat Mumbai’s Natural Icecream to see when I will get satiated. I fell sick but satiation was not reached.It may take you some time on PBWF diet before you regain those sensitivities. Getting off on all medications would be one such point. 

3. People ask if nuts should be eaten during summer. Your body will tell you when it doesn’t want nuts. If your A/C is broken down and it is 45 degrees centigrade outside, your body may want you to have a watermelon instead of nuts. If your body is well tuned it will not misguide you. 

4. To look for specific foods for each specific nutrient is flawed. You will go crazy, and what about the nutrients that have not yet been discovered. How will you find them. Eat variety of food from all five food groups. You will not experience any deficiencies. 

5. When I say something has x% protein it means of total calories provided x% come from protein. When I say 95% is water it is by total weight.

6. There will not be any protein deficiency on PBWF diet. The problem today is not protein deficiency; it is the excess of protein. 

7. In making green juice we are not trying to achieve any particular chemistry. So do not worry if some vegetables I mention are not available where you live. Add whatever is available. The idea is to consume green leafy vegetables in large amounts. Those who are prone to getting kidney stones should avoid greens rich in oxalates like spinach, chard and beet greens. 

8.  When it comes to soluble and insoluble fiber, there is no such thing as ideal ratio. Fruits and legumes have more soluble fiber and leafy vegetables have more insoluble fiber. There is no need to make nutrition more difficult than it needs to be. Eat whatever you like and as muych you like. Your body will signal you when you have had enough.

9. It is a mistake to think than green juice is for losing weight. All people need to consume it. Many underweight people gain weight when they go on PBWF/IF/10K program because, increased walking builds appetite. 

10. Coconut is very healthy. Coconut water is exceptionally good. Coconut milk and butter are also acceptable. Only coconut oil is bad. I only allow consumption of oil of upto 2 teaspoons a day by those who are healthy and not on any medications. If you fit that profile you can use coconut oil, but everything you would do with it can also be done with ghee. Ghee is better as it has a bette omega-6 to omega-3 ratio.

11. When it comes to walking the benefits lie on a continuum; more is better than less. Recommending a number 10K is arbitrary but if I say 9,746 steps it might get misconstrued as a step curve which it is not. A rounded number10K is simple to remember. In Blue zones around the world people on average walk over 13,000 steps. Try to maintain an average of at least 70,000 per week. 

12. If you can not walk, you can do other exercises as long as total activity is equivalent to 10 K steps. Swimming is exceptionally good. Biking is fine except that it doesn’t involve arm movement. Yoga is good but not sufficient movement.

13. Eating only egg whites is as unhealthy as eating eggs, because all the protein is still there and animal protein promotes cancer.

14. Every one must calculate their Body Mass Index. The healthy range internationally is between 18.5 and 25. For Indians it is considered between 17 and 23. The lower the better. One can get the formula on google by typing BMI. 

15. You can not use buttermilk or skim milk. You do not want any milk protein or milk fat. If you must consume some milk based product for religious reasons, you could use the left over water after removing Paneer, as long as this comes from cows who are free roaming and grass fed, with no hormone or antibiotic injections. I don’t recommend it but it is acceptable. 

16. All vegetable oils and nut oils are unhealthy. I recommend Mustard oil (kacchi ghani) and desi ghee (butter oil) only as exceptions. These two are the least harmful of all oils because of decent omega-3 to omega-6 ratio. Canola oil also has a good ratio but it is highly refined. You must understand that peanuts are much healthier than peanut oil. Sesame seeds, coconuts, olives are all very healthy and must be eaten. There oils are not healthy and should be avoided. Their butters are okay because they are whole food and fat is embedded in fibers.

17. It is incorrect to think that what we eat at 8:00 or 9:00 AM is breakfast and at 11:00 or 12:00 is lunch. Breakfast is the first meal of the day and it should be the heaviest meal. What time you take this meal is up to you. Your dinner must finish within 8 hours of your breakfast starting time and should be at least 3 hours before you go to bed. Also preferably before it is dark outside. 

18. Even those for whom, being overweight is not the issue, should follow narrow eating window. It is a very healthy practice and prevents developing diabetes and liver diseases.

19. Pregnant ladies and children under 16 can maintain a longer eating window of upto 12 hours.

20. I do not recommend vitamin B complex. One should only take vitamin B-12 supplement. The maintenance dose recommended is 50-300mcg daily or 2,000 mcg weekly. If you are deficient you can double the dose. 

21. It is best to get vitamin D-3 through exposure to sun. D-3 supplements are not without controversy. There is some concern about kidney stone formation. 

22. No other supplements. None at all. As regards to some Ayurvedic supplements like Ashwagandha etc. my recommendations is make them part of your meal just like you do with cloves or bay leaves or cardamom. Do not take as supplements. They only help if you are deficient. Once you are on on PBWF for a few months all deficiencies will be gone. Then supplements become more harmful than helpful. 

23. A tablespoon of Lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, or aamla extract, or tulsi extract etc. are all fine in the morning warm water. There is no conclusive research as to which is better. There are some experts who believe that plain water is better and all such things should be consumed during eating window.

24. Do not look for better grains. Eat whatever grains you like and some that you don’t. Variety is good. If a particular grain doesn’t suit you don’t eat it. Eat as close to the whole form as possible. Less processed is better than more processed. Millets are good, Sorghum is good, Quinoa is good, Corn is good, Rice is good and Wheat is also good. Eat whatever you like. To focus and differentiate on them is not a good idea. If something doesn’t suit you don’t eat. You have bigger problems to tackle. Lot of people like to find an easy escape goat by blaming their problems on gluten or rice. That is focusing on the wrong thing.

25. Oatmeal that I recommend is steel cut variety and made by Quaker Oats also. What many refer to is the rolled variety which are slightly processed. Rolled oats are used to make oat milk. Just blend one cup rolled oats with 1/4 cashew and 4 cups of water to make oat milk. 

26. Rule of thumb to select a readymade bread is total carb to fiber ratio of under five. In US I have found Dave’s “21 grain & seed” bread to be the best. 

27. Monk fruit and Sevia are okay to eat as fruit or herbal tea but not as sweetener. 

28. All diabetics should also eat fruits and berries as recommended. 

29. Maintaining low blood sugar and reversing diabetes are two separate goals. Reversing diabetes requires increasing insulin sensitivity. Eating starch (unprocessed whole form) may increase blood sugar but it increases insulin sensitivity.

30. Diabetics also should do intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting. In fact they benefit the most. During fasting any medication to lower blood sugar should be avoided but you must consult your physician. 

31. All diabetics should get a continuous glucose meter called FreeStyle Libre made by Abbott Labs. You do not need to buy the monitor as your cell phone can record the readings. You do need a doctor’s prescription. on to buy this. It will give you a daily reading for A1C. As per revised guidelines by American College of physicians (ACP), your goal should be to maintain A1C under 8.0. 

32. Soaking nuts is a good idea but it isn’t as big a deal as you read in social media.

33. There is a date sugar available which is nothing but pulverized whole dates. You can use this and as much as you want. Dates as fruits can also be used in various puddings made with coconut or oat milk. Replacing sugar in tea can take some time. I personally found it easier to give up tea all together. One trick is to do in steps. First add 25% date sugar into regular sugar than after a week or two make it 50/50. Then 75/25 and finally only date sugar.

34. Palm date sugar is not good. It is refined just like white sugar. 

35. The fiber, that is rejected while juicing, has very little nutrient value and should be thrown away or used to make compost. Depending upon the quality of juicer, if fiber is moist, it can be run through the juicer second time. In hydraulic and dual helical juicers it is not required as pulp is very dry. That is why I recommend those juicers.

36. I will cover some recipes during the last week. One can go to google and YouTube for recipes.

37. Please don’t think of PBWF/IF/10K as a diet program, to be followed for a few months. It is a lifestyle change for ever.

## 2 Most FAQs

Today I want to discuss two of the most frequently asked questions and why they are flawed to begin with. 

(1) The first question is:
“What should be a diet to prevent Diabetes or stroke or heart attack or hypertension or asthma or arthritis or Alzheimer’s etc. etc.)?”

The problem with this question is that, it presumes that the healthy diet for different diseases must be different. 

If it was to be so, how do we decide which disease we want to prevent and which disease we don’t want to prevent. I think the premise is illogical. Any diet to be acceptable must benefit all chronic diseases. The PBWF/IF/10K diet and lifestyle I recommend, helps prevent and cure all chronic diseases. For people who have reached advanced level of an illness (breakdown) or who have artificial organs or body parts, clearly one needs to consult doctors who specialize in such organs. Most of the components of the diet are pretty benign and should not create any problem with few exceptions; one that comes to mind is restriction on some green leafy vegetables (rich in oxalates) for advanced stage kidney diseases. 

(2) The second question is :
“I have this… this… this… (narrative on symptoms experienced) what should be my diet?”

Here again the same explanation applies as mentioned above. 
The deficiencies (and excesses) in nutrients manifest as symptoms, but more often than not, these symptoms  are not identical in all human beings. Even though genetically we are very similar, epigenetically we all are very different, so the symptoms we experience for the identical deficiencies (and excesses) are not identical. 

What further aggravates this is the fact that we often do not suffer from only one nutrient. So if there is deficiencies in multiple nutrients the number of permutations and combinations can run into thousand if not millions. To expect that a doctor can identify these by listening to you is unrealistic. That is why you find that both in medicine and alternative medicine field, it is always a hit or miss. 

Another problem we have is that, when one faces a miss, he quietly accept it, but when his experience is a hit and cures his symptoms, he tells everyone around him. Comments like “I had been having this problem for 10 years and seen 10 doctors and no body could help, but this alternate medicine doctor (Hakim, Vaidya, Homeopath or Ayurveda or whatever doctor) solved it. Now this person is so elated that he tells tens of people. So nine who didn’t benefit kept quite but one who did benefit told ten others. It creation an impression that this doctor’s remedy is a sure shot winner. 

The beauty of PBWF/IF/10k diet is that it removes all deficiencies (and excesses also which can also be toxic), so the problem gets cured. That is why I initially recommend a green juice fast for 3-5 days. It provides both detoxification and hyper nutrition.

Many people raise the issue of Ayurveda and that milk and ghee is highly recommended in Ayurveda so how can it be bad. Here is my my response to that. 👇

My knowledge about Ayurveda is limited and only second hand. I have high respect for Ayurveda and the only difference with the PBWF that I am aware of is regarding dairy, ghee and vegetable oils. Some people have told me that a Kerala school of Ayurveda doesn’t allow milk. Some others have also told me that some Ayurvedic practitioners allow some non-veg. .
When our university at Takshshila was burned how much knowledge base was retained and how much was lost is difficult to tell. There is scant historical evidence available. At least for Nalanda University, we do know more. 
There must have been more literature besides Charak Samhita, Susruta-Samhita and Atreyas Muni Samhita that got lost in those deliberate fires and destruction. 

Where I do respect Ayurveda is in two areas:
1. Ayurveda recognizes that all human beings are not similar and categorizes them into three major types and a total of 10 different types. 
2. Ayurveda believes that **“when diet is wrong medicine is of no use and when diet is right medicine is of no need”.** In spite of that when you look around everybody is too eager to provide Ayurvedic medicines or supplements, which is contradiction in itself. No body wants to change the diet or lifestyle; they are too attached to their foods. Many Ayurvedic supplements have added sugar and/or honey making them less beneficial. 

My main concern with Ayurveda practitioners is that most do not appear to be deeply rooted in it. I personally have been diagnosed of all three doshas by three different Ayurvedic practitioners. 

In US at least any alternative medicine practitioner is required to have a MD degree first, which I think is not the case in India.
