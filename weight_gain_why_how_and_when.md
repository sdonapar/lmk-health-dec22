# WEIGHT GAIN:Why, How & When 

(This writeup is a simplistic explanation to make some general points. The subject of appetite and food intake is complex and still unresolved)

When a child is growing he needs to eat more calories than what he is expending every day to grow. A 6 pound child grows into a 150 pound adult by the age of 18; that is a gain of 144 pounds in 18 years. Considering that 3,500 calories are equivalent to one pound of fat that comes to an energy surplus of;
(144x3,500)/(18x365.25) = 76.7 Calories/Day
Assuming the growth in height, skeleton and muscles (Fat Free Mass) has stopped, the adult will start putting on weight unless he reduces his energy (food) intake or increases activity (Energy Expenditure). Most of us do not increase activity nor do we reduce our caloric intake and the result is weight gain. Assuming diet and level of activity remain unchanged how much weight would one gain?

Typically 50-60% of our total daily energy expenditure of 2,000 calories is used up by the brain and internal organs (Resting Metabolic Rate).The remaining calories aren spent in discretionary physical activities that are a function of body weight (Fat Free Mass + Fat Mass). So assuming an incremental metabolic rate of 6 calories per pound of Fat Mass, (this is an important number as it determines how long it takes one to stabilize weight as a result of any diet or lifestyle change) we come up with an answer of 12.8 pounds. 

Wt.Gain = 76.7/6 = 12.8 lbs.
                        
An extra 12.8 pounds will increase one’s energy expenditure for the same level of activity by 12.8x6= 76.7 calories balancing out the excess. 

Now let us take a look at how long would it take one to gain this weight. 

Time taken= 12.8x3500/76.7
                      = 583 days

The time taken to achieve this new weight of 162.8 pounds would be 583 days. 
 
Now let us assume the person turns 21 and starts drinking with friends modestly, say an average of one drink a day. That 100 calories a day would lead to another weight gain of 16.7 pounds, also in 583 days. 
 
Now the weight is 179.5 pounds and say the person gets married at the age of 27. After marriage some changes in lifestyle are expected and let us say he starts a new habit of spending quality time with his wife every morning over two cups of tea (with milk and sugar) and 2 rusks. That is another 120 calories a day. Assuming nothing else changed, the weight gain would be 20 pounds, also in 583 days. So now the total weight is 199.5 pounds. This is what happens to most of us. 
My purpose in giving this simplified example is to point out that minor changes in life go a long way in improving or worsening our health. 
The reverse of this is also true. A point I made in “My Story” post about changing my breakfast habit from toast, butter and eggs to oatmeal in 2012. 

It is interesting to note that the time taken is the same 19-20 months (583 days) for every habitual change. I wasn’t anticipating this when I started to write this post but it is quite understandable and is simply a function of one’s incremental metabolic rate for Fat Mass in his body. This would vary from person to person but fall within a range of 5-7. 

There is one other factor that comes into play after the age of 50. Our metabolic rate begins to slow down further, reducing the caloric requirement for the same level of activity. This causes further weight gain. 

So give this some thought and start making your own changes today. Small changes can make big differences over time. Each of us has to find our  own way.
