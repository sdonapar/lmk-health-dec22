# 2.2 DIET & LIFESTYLE MYTHS

As we grow from a 2 year old child who has just been weaned, we are exposed to foods that our parents and/or grand parents thought was healthy. The information they inherited from their parents or acquired through education or through media or through interactions with their doctors. The doctors in their education learn a lot about diseases and medicines but are not taught much about nutrition. In US, medical college provides less than few hours of lectures on the subject of nutrition. The result is often blind leading a blind. 
There are many myths about nutrition and there are lot of vested interests in propagating these myths. 
Some common myths about food are :

1. Everything in moderation is good: No, when you do that you get disease also in moderation and we blame it on old age. Diseases we associate with old age have little to do with old age and more to do with our faulty diet and lifestyle. 
2. You can wait to change your diet: No, one must implement the corrective changes in diet and lifestyle without delay. Diseases do progress to a point of no return if delayed too long. 
3. Exercise can make up for unhealthy diet: No, this is a very common myth among young people who go to gym. About half the people who die of first heart attack have normal blood chemistry and no symptoms. 
4. A little bit can’t hurt: No some toxins are cumulative and can hurt in the long turn. Exposure to radiation is one of those. Heavy metal poisoning is also like that. 
5. If a little is good, more is better: No many minerals should only be consumed in smaller quantities. There is interference among minerals snd one needs to be cautious. This is why supplements are discouraged. This is also how people start consuming too much protein. 
6. One should eat more protein; protein builds muscles: No, this is one of the most common myth Protein does not build muscles; muscles are built by putting them through stress exercises. Muscles used stay in shape. If you don’t use them you lose them. 
7. Carbs are fattening; low carb diets are healthy: No, carbs are the most important part of diet and need to be the largest component of your diet (60-80 percent). They should be consumed in complex form which is natural unrefined form. 
8. Carbs raise insulin level while protein lowers it: No, this is true for refined carbs: No, unrefined carbs are complex carbs where sugar is embedded in the fibers and it is released slowly. 
9. Cow’s Milk is the best source of Calcium: No, cow’s milk causes acidosis which requires bleaching calcium out of the bones to neutralize the acidity. Countries with most dairy consumption have highest hip fracture rates. 
10. Calcium is what makes your bones strong: No, bones become strong when exposed to stress. Calcium is brittle and weak like a chalk stick used to write on blackboards. 
11. You need to eat meat for iron: No, green leafy vegetables are the best source of iron. Meat has many problems. 
12. Chicken is healthier than Beef or mutton meat: No, they all are equally bad. Poultry farm chicken are injected with brine making them worse than other meats. 
13. Fish have good fat. Fish or fish oil is your best source for Omega-3: it is true that fresh water fish is rich in Omega3 but Flaxseeds, Chiaseeds , Hempseeds, walnuts and mustard seeds are also great source of Omega3 and have no negative issues. Fish Oil fraud has been exposed. 
14. Grilling Animal food makes them healthy: 
It only removes some fat other problems remain. Also browning meat and chicken is carcinogenic. 
15. A glass of Red Wine is good for you: No, it is only less harmful that white wine or other alcohol drinks. Avoiding all alcohol is the safest. 
16. Artificial sweeteners are good for diabetics and overweight people: No, they cause weight gain. 
17. We should dissect our food into protein, fat, carbs, vitamins and minerals and monitor their consumption: No, handling nutrition in reductionist fashion is flawed. One should think in terms of Whole Foods as nutrition.
