# FAQs Week-2

Here are some questions asked in the past groups at this stage. 

## QUESTION-1:

Why are you opposed to drinking fruit juices? Water melon whether as juice or eaten as pieces amounts to same since there is very little wasted fiber. What is your take on this?
ANSWER:
When we eat fruit, it stays in the mouth longer and mixes with saliva; this is very healthy. Juice does not achieve that. You can drink juice of one pound watermelon in 30 seconds but it takes 10 times as much to eat. What is important is how slowly sugar is reaching your blood.

## QUESTION-2:

I am tempted to pick up all the greens in the grocery store - are there any greens to be avoided?
ANSWER:
No. 
Any thing that is edible otherwise (as raw) can be juiced. In terms of quantity use common sense. Things you eat in smaller quantities should be put in juice also in smaller quantities, like ginger, cilantro, mint etc.
There is one exception for those who are prone to getting kidney stones. They should avoid greens which are rich in oxalates; these include spinach, chard and beetroot greens. Kale is perfect with negligible oxalates. 

## QUESTION-3:

Should one strain (with a tea strainer) the green juice after juicing or consume it as is?
The green juice taken three times a day is very filling and leaves no room for meals for me. 
ANSWER:
A good juicer removes most of the pulp. If juicer is single augur type it may leave significant pulp in it which can cause bloating. It is a good idea to strain this juice. A tea strainer may not be sufficient. The finer the strainer the better it is. You can also use a nut milk straining bags or some cheese cloth. 

# QUESTION-4:

Are there any disadvantages of consuming green juices alongside food (rather than before)? Say I eat lunch and have juice side by side, does that work well too?
ANSWER:
By drinking juice early it bypasses the digestive cycle of the stomach and gets to small intestines before food comes. Some people have stomach issues if combined. I suppose you can try and see if it creates any issues for you.

# QUESTION-5:

Hello Lalitji.......juicing is taking up a lot of time...is it okay to refrigerate diced veggies and juice as required? Or will I lose nutrients ?
ANSWER:
It is not a good idea to chop vegetables in advance and store them in refrigerator. They loose nutrition value. You are better of storing juice in air tight glass bottles in the refrigerator. 

# QUESTION-6:

Will this diet help loose the body fat along with the weight?  I started doing this two weeks ago and have lost a little bit of weight however I don’t see any improvement with the body fat. What steps should I take in order to also loose the body fat?
ANSWER:
What you are losing is body fat only. All overweight people lose fat on this program. Your weight comprises of bones, organs, muscles and fat. You do not loose muscle or bone weight. All weight loss is fat loss only. The fat you lose is from all over your body. If you are hoping to lose only tummy fat than you are mistaken. For that you need to do stress exercises like sit-ups, push-ups pull-ups etc.
If you want to lose weight faster, do not consume any more nuts&seeds than recommended as minimum. If you want to lose weight even faster, increase consumption of green vegetables more and cut down on the rice and grain group and starchy vegetables. 
Of course, the fastest way to lose weight is water fasting or green juice fasting or OMAD (one meal a day of under 500 calories). OMAD is like Navratre fasting. I will cover this subject next week.

# QUESTION-7

What is the best substitute for sugar?
ANSWER:
Date sugar, Date syrup and Black molasses. 

# QUESTION-8:

Kindly share if there are any additional inputs to be followed for growing kids, below 10 years.
ANSWER:
Diet remains the same. Only difference is that you can have slightly longer eating window of 10-12 hours.

# QUESTION-9:

Can practicing yoga help solve chronic problems?
ANSWER:
Yoga, Pranayam and meditation are very good and helpful but one must stop consuming foods that are causing the problem in the first place. One must not assume that Yoga will make up for dietary deficiencies.

# QUESTION-10:

Is decaf green tea good to have late evening. 
ANSWER:
I do not know why people want to have tea or coffee which have been decaffed. Decaffing requires significant processing which I would have you rather avoid. There are many other options available like Hibiscus tea, Kashmiri Kahwa or ginger&lemon tea etc. 

# QUESTION-11:

How can I measure how much protein to have in a day? I understand it’s 8% but since so many foods including veggies have protein, how can I know when I’ve eaten 8%?
ANSWER:
You must stop counting nutrients. Your body is smarter than you and takes what it needs or knows what to do if you take more as long as it is recognized as the food that it has consumed for millions of years. That is why PBWF is important. Processed food, it does not recognize and get confused. In fact the PhDs hired by the process food industry have a single focus; how to circumvent your body’s satiation mechanism and make you eat more and buy more.

# QUESTION-12:

In India it is recommended to have a teaspoon of cow’s ghee in the daily diet. Especially if the diet has jowar/bajree rotis which is very dry. Ghee is also recommended as one ages. Seniors say that they don’t have cracked heels, dry skin or hair because of the ghee, Makhhan (white butter), and butter milk which has been a part of diet. Is there truth in the above beliefs? What’s the alternative to ghee in PBWF?
ANSWER:
Indians are also suffering a lot from chronic diseases and have shorter life expectancy among civilized nations. 
One must understand that ghee and oil, once digested, don’t remain that oily, greasy substance. They get converted into fatty acids. External application of mustard oil and ghee are good. One must do such massages every two weeks or more often if time permits.
You do get fat in PBWF as it is in all nuts&seeds, chick peas, avocados etc. 

# QUESTION-13:

During the eating window, is there a specific time break one needs to give in between meals?
ANSWER:
No. Let your body tell you.
You can have two or three meals. It is up to you. You can add a snack also if you feel like.

# QUESTION-14:

I have always been vegetarian but this PBWF plan has made an Immediate difference in feeling energetic. Why is that so?
ANSWER:
The most common feed back I get is about feeling more energetic. There is no easy marker to measure that. One marker I have found personally is the distance one can walk without getting tired and without feeling the muscle pain the next day. My limit at age 63 was about 4 miles. When ever I did 5 miles I felt some muscle pain the following day. Now at age 72 my limit is 13 miles. I haven’t tried longer.

# QUESTION-15:

For the 8 hour eating window.   Do you have a preference among following:
8:00 AM - 4:00 PM
9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
10:00 AM - 6:00 PM
11:00 AM - 7:00 PM
Any advantage of one over the other - or just personal preference?
ANSWER:
Early eating window is always better than late. It is best to finish dinner before it is dark outside. Also it is a good idea to not consume any food for 2 hours after getting up. So you need to make your own schedule. For working people, it is difficult to have dinner before 6:00, so 10:00 to 6:00 is quite practical. Also most restaurants, in US at least, are open by 5:30 PM, so you can eat out and socialize. Do the best you can.

# QUESTION-16:

I am observing that my blood sugar is going up. I used to have fasting sugar level at 125-135 but now it is 140-150. I had actually stopped medication for sugar for first 4/5 days but have now restarted it. Is it a concern?
ANSWER:
Naturally stopping medicine will make a change in your blood sugar. You should not be concerned. Your goal is not to maintain low blood sugar. Your goal is to increase insulin sensitivity which takes some time. Fasting glucose is a flawed indicator of your diabetic health. We will cover it shortly. The best way to measure your blood glucose levels is with a continuous glucose meter patch which gives you a continuous reading for 14 days. It is called FreeStyle Libre and made by Abbott Labs. You do not need to buy the meter as you can use your mobile phone for that. 

# QUESTION -17:

I do heavy weigh lifting. How do I increase my protein intake besides eating daals and tofu non stop?
ANSWER:
When you do heavy weight lifting you spend more calories than normal. This gets compensated by your increased diet which provided the extra protein. Human body is good at recycling protein in an average person 85% of spent protein gets recycled. Obviously, protein lost in hair nail and skin growth can not be recycled. When you do heavy exercises the recycle ratio improves further because you hair, nail and skin do not grow any faster. 
You must watch the documentary “The Game Changers”. It is great for heavy work out people like you.
Also you are mistaken if you think daal and tofu is needed for protein. Spinach has 30% protein, Romain lettuce has 19%, watermelon 8%, rice 7% and even potatoes at 6%. Mother’s milk which nature provided for fastest growing period in human life span has only 5.5 % protein, which is all that one need and no body is growing at a faster pace than a new born child.

# QUESTION-18:

Spirulina is a complete plant protein (all 8-9 essential amino acids)...and 60% by weight. So it should be healthy?
ANSWER:
Just because something is plant based doesn’t mean it is healthy. This is the main point I have been trying hammer in this group. Potato chips are also plant based, sugar is plant based, all vegetable oils are plant based. Dr. Janice’s video “Dangerous Truth about Protein” that was posted as attachment to my post on Protein, has addressed your specific question. Please do watch it. 


# QUESTION-19:

Should dry fruits be eaten soaked in water or dry? Are California almonds not as healthy as Kashmiri?
ANSWER
Dry fruits (figs, apricots, raisins etc.) should be eaten dry. Nuts can be eaten soaked or dry. The difference is infitesamal. Focus on bigger things like how to get rid of oil and ghee from your diet. I have noticed that we Indians debate a lot about such things and then we go and add milk to our tea or have a glass of milk with sugar before bedtime. Stop focusing on smaller details. Stop your eggs, dairy, ghee and sugar first. 
California almonds are very healthy and can be eaten with or without skin. I have noticed many people become argumentative on such issues and quote their favorite sources to support their position. I have not come across any double blind study to substantiate various positions in any significant manner. Eating unsoaked nuts will not hurt you. 

# QUESTION-20:

Can spices like clove, cardemom, fennel seed etc and green tea, black tea (without milk/sugar) be consumed in fasting window?
ANSWER:
Only soluble extract can be used but generally not a good idea. Why not consume them during eating window. Many fasting experts are opposed to consuming anything besides water. These are giants in t no heir field with decades of experience.  

# FEW GENERAL COMMENTS:

1. There is no need to describe symptoms to me. I am not a doctor and I do not diagnose symptoms. My focus is on diet and lifestyle. All chronic illnesses are caused due to deficiencies in diet or toxicity but different people respond differently to such deficiencies and toxicities. That is not only because of genetic differences but more due to their gut microbiome makeup which differs for each person. Human body has more foreign cells (38 trillion) then native cells (30 trillion). As a result our diet, lifestyle and environment has more to do with health than genes. 

The best way to self diagnose is to evaluate  diet and lifestyle on each of 14 recommendations, you will find your answers. Many people find, that when they do this self evaluation, they were non compliant much more than they thought. 

2. In spite of my post on the very first day “One Diet for All Ills”, many of you still believe there should be a different diet for your illness. This isn’t so. Just follow all the guidelines to the best of your ability and you will notice the improvements.

# Questsions from Whatsapp Group

QUESTION: What reduction rate should we followed while going through weight reduction.
Is there any adverse effect of reducing weight quickly while undergoing extreme strength training and diet control?

ANSWER: I don’t suggest focusing on reduction rate. You focus on diet, your body will decide about the reduction rate.

QUESTION: When I search Google, it doesnot show the amount of protein content which you mentioned rather it shows very less. Where am I getting it wrong? For spinach, watermelon, potato..where should I see?

ANSWER: It depends what units. I talk about as % of total protein and not as grams.

QUESTION: Is fish consumption ok?

ANSWER: No. Definitely not if you are diseased and trying to recover. If you are otherwise healthy meaning not on any medications, you can have fresh water fish like salmon, as an exception, once a month or so.

QUESTION: Is consuming  double toned milk(mother dairy) 1 glass without sugar with breakfast and 1 glass in evening is alright or giving up milk completely slowly should be the goal? Asking as this food habit has a strong hold.

ANSWER: Toned milk is worse as it’s protein content as a % of total calories is even higher. 
Please please please avoid all dairy products. The only product acceptable in moderation is ghee but only for those who are otherwise healthy.

ANSWER:  don’t know, I am not a doctor. Eating veggies and oats is not enough. You must follow all 12 point guidelines.

## General Comment

There are still many in this group who think that I am some kind of a doctor who will provide a dietary solution to their unique health problems (symptoms). Please understand, that is not the case. I am not a doctor and I do not analyze your symptoms, I am a diet & lifestyle coach. and that is all I analyze. When you correct diet and lifestyle, the diseases and symptoms which are due to improper diet and lifestyle, known as lifestyle diseases or chronic diseases, reverse themselves. This healing is done by your body and it is unique to everyone because, even though genetically we are very similar, epigenetically we all are very different. To group people into one or three groups is only an approximation and any treatments based on that would only be approximate and likely to result in a hit or miss. This is common in all forms of treatments: allopathic, Ayurvedic, homeopathic etc. 
There is always a bias to share successes, so when a person gets healed by a treatment, he shares that success story with many, even news media likes to publish such stories. When a person is not healed by that same treatment he doesn’t go around telling people about treatment’s failure and news media has little interest in publishing that story. It is as if they are saying, that the fact that your treatment did not succeed is not a big story, there are many people who are not cured by this treatment so they are not interested in publishing it. This bias against negative stories creates a false picture and misleads many to seek that treatment. As I had said in the very beginning, all science is imperfect including medical science, and we are continuously expanding our knowledge. Treatments designed based on that imperfect knowledge are also imperfect. Your body knows lot more than you give it credit for. It is as if all expert doctors are within your body and every second they are trying to decide the right course of action. All you need to do is to avoid hurting it by feeding unhealthy foods and provide hyper nutrition that it has been denied for a long time. 
The recommendations made in this group work in a holistic fashion and apply to most. There is always a chance that few would not be able to cure the disease completely but that number is very small and is more of an exception than the rule. Once the body reaches breaking point, it is difficult to reverse. Even in those cases they are likely to get off medications and achieve an optimal state of health. We will cover this in two weeks.
