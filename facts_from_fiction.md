How to Navigate among Varying Opinions on Social Media?

This question gets asked often. The social media and specially YouTube is full of varying opinions so how do I navigate it. Here are some suggestions which I practice. 

1. One must eliminate all anecdotal evidences. Videos by people of their personal experiences. 

2. One must eliminate self appointed coaches who are not educationally qualified. For example just because your coach at gym has a great body doesn’t mean that the protein powder he is pushing you to buy will get you that body. YouTube is full of those. 

3. Having narrowed down to qualified people like nutritionists, doctors, professors and PhDs, try to understand their logic in the explanation, is it consistent with what you have learned so far; if not, is the evidence based on double blind studies that have been peer reviewed. Do you smell bias based on food, Pharma or health care industries interest. Was the research funded by independent agency like National Institute of Health (NIH) or some other well recognized international organization or university. 

4. Does the expert have an ax to grind or a turf to protect. Does he have a conflict of interest. 

5. Now if there are genuine differences in the recommendations of the two experts, apply some acid test. Is the expert following his own advice? Does his health and physical appearance support his argument. Dr. Atkins advised everyone to follow his low carb high fat diet to lose weight but he himself was grossly overweight. When he died at the age of 72 he weighed 258 pounds. Many proponents of dairy and keto diets are overweight themselves. 

Those who survive to this point may be honest in their disagreements. When two doctors, I respect, are in conflict,  I apply some common sense and evaluate other available data, to come to my decision. I look at the findings from human evolutionary perspective as I discussed in my very first post on human evolution. Here are some examples of conflicts among the doctors I respect and follow:

1. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn doesn’t approve of fat even in natural forms like avocado, nuts and seeds. When you analyze his experience, he deals primarily with advanced stage heart patients who have been given a short life to live. His success rate is already 99.5%. Why should he change? He can’t afford to take any additional risk. 

2. Dr.John McDougall is opposed to more vegetables and fruits beyond a few servings. He wants you to eat more starch. That has been his life’s body of work and all his books are focused on that. He has no objection to raw fruits and vegetables; he just feels that they won’t fill your stomach. His argument against them is week and he does have a turf to protect. I do consider him my guru but I disagree on restricting fruits, vegetables.

3. Dr. McDougall in his seminars is very opposed to nuts and seeds beyond one oz. total. Most of his patients are fat and overweight, so I don’t blame him. In India I come across many patients who are underweight (BMI under 18.5), I advise them to increase consumption from the nuts & seeds group. 

4. Dr. Fuhrman recommends high consumption of fruits and vegetables but he sells food supplements that he manufactures. Most PBWF doctors disagree with that. 

5. Most of these doctors have developed a turf that they believe in and want to protect and have arguments to support them which sound reasonable on the surface and they are slow to adopt new research. For example many have not adopted the recent developments on fasting. I was quick to adopt that because of my Indian background, it resonated with me. Also two Nobel prizes (2016 and 2018) are pretty convincing. 

6. Dr. Jason Fung was the first to adopt fasting as a way to treat Diabetes. Before him fasting was a novelty, as a treatment of last resort. There were only few clinics worldwide. However Dr. Jason Fung’s focus on keto diet has been widely debunked but there is strong backing by the animal food industries.

As you can see there is no agreement even among the knowledgeable people. 
Over the years and based on the feedback from thousands of members, my guidelines have evolved to where they are today.
