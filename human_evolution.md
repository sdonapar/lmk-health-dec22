# 1.12 HUMAN  EVOLUTION

There are three observations to be made about our human history. 

1. Human beings have been in existence for over 2 million years and have evolved over many more millions of years. Initially, our ancestors lived primarily on trees eating fruits and roots. As the climate changed and trees thinned out, our ancestors couldn’t just jump from tree to tree and had to start walking a few steps to get to the next tree. As the trees moved further apart,  walking had to become more efficient and they started moving on hind legs. The grains growing on wild grasses,  became part of our ancestors diet. Also, meat left over by carnivorous animals became part of the diet. We thus evolved to become gatherers and scavengers and small game hunters. It was much later, as our tools evolved and became more powerful, were we able to kill large animals. 
As a result, our diet primarily consisted of wild plant based food with very small portions of animal food. The fossilized poop analysis has shown that the animal food comprised less than 5% of the Paleo diet. It was only 10,000 years ago that we settled down and domesticated animals. 

2. All animals living in the wild, even today, do not require any veterinarian visits or medications. The food they eat is in natural form and unprocessed. Their main concern  is finding food and the fear of the predators. Most sicknesses among them are either food related or attacks by insects and leaches. When they get sick, they usually stop eating for a few days or modify their diet by looking for some special plant or food. 

3. Throughout the bulk of human history, like all wild animals, our body was self healing without any need for inorganic medicines or visits to doctors and hospitals. When we were indisposed our body told us what to do and it mostly involved:
- Resting
- Fasting
- Changing food
- Nature cures like messages 

Even in the last two thousand years, doctors advised us “Let the food be Thy medicine”. 
Most people tried kitchen herbal remedies and fasting. When we visited a doctor (Vaid, Hakim or a nature path) his focus was on analyzing our diet, poop, urine, and physical symptoms. His prescription of medicine included some herbal concoction and instructions to avoid certain foods, while taking that concoction.(In Hindi it was called Perhej). Some times they also prescribed that the medicine should always be consumed with a cup of some food or a glass of some juice. We would never know whether the medicine did the trick or the avoidance of certain foods or inclusion of some foods or juice or just the placebo, but it worked most of the time. Probably all four played some role. 

Plant Based Whole Food (PBWF) (also called by some Whole Food Plant Based) Doctors believe that root cause of all chronic illnesses today is the food we eat and the lifestyle we lead and when we change that, all chronic illnesses disappear. 

Our body has evolved, to self heal and when we interfere with that healing process by taking medications to suppress symptoms (which were part of the compensating mechanism) additional complications arise requiring more medications and the dependence on medications keeps on increasing. This puts us in a vicious circle, the end of which is organ failure and death.
