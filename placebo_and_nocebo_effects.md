# PLACEBO & NOCEBO EFFECTS

We have known for some time that a patients belief in a certain medication or treatment plays an important role in his recovery. Many alternate forms of treatments practiced for centuries or even millenniums have produced surprising results. Even I have memories of visiting Hakims and Vaidyas 60+ years ago. Such care providers (incorrectly called doctors) always had good bedside manners and asked many questions as to what was your diet, how was your pea and poop, any aches or pains, color of tongue and eyes etc. . After thorough examination they gave a medication in small paper packages (pudia). They also prescribed some restrictions (parhej) on food; what to avoid and what to take while on that medication. In most cases the health improved within a week or two. Now the only thing that was not clear was: what healed the body?
1. Was it the medication or 
2. Was it the changes in the diet or 
3. The body healed by itself or 
4. The positive belief of the mind healed the body. 

What I have learned from my PBWF doctors is that our body is a very sophisticated organism and it is always trying to heal itself. So most likely the body healed because of 2,3 and 4 above but what was in that paper pudia was probably immaterial. 
All drug trials for new drugs have to go through rigorous double blind studies where the test group is divided into two equal groups and one group is administered the actual drug being tested and the other group is given an inactive substance with no therapeutic value. Both the groups are told that they are receiving the drugs. Generally the patients in both groups see some benefits. For the drug to be approved, the study needs to demonstrate that the group receiving the drug had statistically better results than the placebo group. These are called the double blind trials, because neither the patient nor the doctor knows which group is getting real medication and which group is getting placebo. 

Interestingly what we have learnt in recent years is that the reverse  of placebo is also true called Nocebo; when we believe something bad is going to happen to us, it often does. 
In old Indian Puranic stories, there is often a reference to curse being put on someone. The principal by which this curse probably worked was same as what we call Nocebo effect. Please watch the linked videos below on the subject. ðŸ‘‡
