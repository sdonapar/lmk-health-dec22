# NAVRATRI FAST

In most cultures it is believed that there are demons (negative tendencies) within us which make us do the wrong and evil. Navratri is the nine days period when we fight and defeat these demons within us. Exemplified in victory of Ram over 10 headed Ravan or 9 visits by Mother Durga to our homes to kill these demons within us. Dash-hara means to concur the 10 (demons). Our ancestors had beautifully tied the wisdom of their knowledge through religious strings to increase compliance.

The modern science is only catching up to what our ancestors knew intuitively. It was only in year 2016 and 2018 that Nobel prizes were awarded to scientists who demonstrated how and why fasting is so therapeutic. First a note about the demons we are trying to eliminate:

1. Ahankar: Ego, Pride
2. Kam (Vasana): Lust
3. Krodh: Wrath, Anger
4. Mada: Stubbornly 
5. Lobha: Greed, Selfishness
6. Moha: Attachment, Delusion 
7. Amanavta: Inhumane Behavior, Cruelty 
8. Anyaya: Injustice 
9. Matsara: Envy (Jealousy)
10. Swarth: Moha: Attachment, Delusion  
11. Sloth: Laziness 
12. Gluttony

The list varies slightly from culture to culture but the idea is the same. Fasting achieves it very well and in various ways by rejuvenating body, mind and intellect. 

Oneâ€™s main goal during Navratri fast is to to create a caloric deficiency and protein deficiency for an extended period of time so that the body can derive the benefits of autophagy and cleans itself of waste protein, misfolded proteins, damaged cells, dead cells and senescent cells. Ideally the fast should be done without any food as it is practiced among Jains called Paryushan  8-Day fast. But that is a bit more difficult for most people to follow. Here are the guidelines for meal during Navratri fasting. 

1. One meal a day (OMAD) only. Have it in the early evening. 
2. The total calories should be 500 or less. 
3. During fasting window of 23 hours consume only water. Avoid any tea or coffee or any other beverages. Take any beverage only during the eating window of one hour including coconut water. 
4. Avoid food which are rich in protein (as a % of total calories). 
5. Avoid foods from the grains and legumes groups as they are rich in protein. 
6. Predominantly eat from fruits and vegetable groups. Their caloric density is low, so they fill up stomach without exceeding total calories. 
7. Within the fruits and vegetables group look for foods which are low in protein. For example apples are better than guavas. 
8. Nuts and Seeds group is okay but in smaller quantities. Have a spoon of flax, Chia or hemp seed to ensure you get your omega-3. 

In this process of Navratri fast, you will lose some weight but that is not the primary purpose of Navratri fast. If weight loss bothers you, you can gain it right back upon completion of the 9 day fast by going back to regular diet.
