# FAQs After Session - 3

Here are some highlights from the past Q&A sessions at this stage. ðŸ‘‡

QUESTION-1:
Juicing is quite time consuming and becomes a chore. What do you think about ordering fresh juices from outside vendors. 
ANSWER-1:
You are correct, it is time consuming and can become a chore. 
I have tried fresh juices at places like Jamba Juice in US. Jamba Juice offers good juice and you can customize it. It is about 8 dollars a glass. I fully support that. I do not know if you can strike a deal and get 6 glasses at a time in some large bottles at a discount. 
Amazon also has a line of juice that they ship in freezer pack. They have a variety pack of six different types but that is not recommended as it included sugary lemonade also.
In India I have seen home delivery of juice in disposable plastic bottles. The quality was not very good. But in India maids can be trained. 
In US we were using a maid to come and make juice twice a week. The total cost comes to same. She was charging $15/hr and it took her about 3.5 hours from start to finish to make 18 glasses of juice. 

QUESTION-2:
Can this diet plan be introduced to young children so that they donâ€™t get any of the chronic health issues and stay healthy? If so what would be the right age? (There is a perception that young kids cannot digest uncooked food).
For kids below 5 yrs, what is the recommendation for omega... how many walnuts / flax seeds?
Answer-2:
The diet I recommend is for all ages including children once they have been weaned off motherâ€™s milk. The only difference for young children is that they can keep a longer eating window of up to 12 hours.

Flaxseeds and walnuts for very young kids can reduce by half. There is no harm in giving extra. My recommendation was only for minimum. There is no upper limit.

QUESTION-3:
Some people say, not to drink water while standing as it affects your knees. Is that true?
ANSWER-3:
It doesnâ€™t affect knees. 
Water should be consumed slowly sip by sip so that saliva gets mixed. So sitting down is a good idea.

QUESTION-4:
Is walking after meals good?
How much time after meals is the best? Half hour? Does walking right after meals not good for digestion?
ANSWER-4:
Wait half hour. 
Walking right after meals is not good for digestion.

QUESTION-5:
In US mustard oil is not allowed for internal consumption. What do you say?
ANSWER-5:
America has not performed any tests on humans. Canada sells Canola which from the same family of seeds but highly processed and refined. There might be some politics at play. India should replicate such rat studies and dispel this myth once and for all. I have never understood why Indian  institutions for higher learning do such independent research themselves.

QUESTION-6:
Any particular house hold cleansers that we should avoid.
ANSWER -6:
We use white vinegar mixed with baking soda, tea tree oil and few drops of soap. 

QUESTION-7:
Women suffering from PCOS are advised to increase protein and have fish/chicken with every meal.What would you suggest for PCOS?
ANSWER-7:
They advise animal protein to every one even cancer patients are advised to eat eggs and have milk. It is a shame. 
No body should eat animal protein. End of discussion.

QUESTION-8:
Recently I saw one video by Dr Khadar Valli who promotes millets a lot. I would like your thoughts on them. His point is the ratio of carbs to fiber is low in millets compared to rice and wheat. But as we are getting good fiber from all the vegetables and fruits, we are probably already good but just want to check before trying millets. 
ANSWER-8:
I am aware of this. I do not believe for this group it makes any difference. I recommend that you eat the grains you like and some that you donâ€™t. The only grains that rate exceptional in my mind are wheat grass and corn on the cob because you eat them practically live.

QUESTION-9:
Instead of taking green juice, I have increased salads portion in my meals & reduced/replaced the components that is unhealthy. However I find my stomach very heavy post lunch. Around evening the stomach feels bloated. What could be happening?
ANSWER-10:
Juice does not make you feel bloated. Salads are generally very light in calories so to get 300 calories you need to eat 3 pounds. That will make any body feel bloated. Most of the vegetables that go in the juice have caloric density of 70-100 calories per pound. So theoretically speaking if you decided to do a vegetable only diet you will have to eat 10 pounds a day to get 1,000 calories. Juicing makes it easy. 

QUESTION-11:
You have recommended walking and exercising during fasting window, is walking during eating window bad?
ANSWER-11:
Walking any time is good except immediately after meals. 
Walking during fasting window enhances the benefits of fasting. Also due to increased metabolic rate you spend more calories for the same distance of walking. 
Also stress exercises during fasts enhances the benefits of fasting.

QUESTION-12:
I did 3 day juice only fast last three days, and my weight dropped 1lb every day - is that too fast and dangerous?
ANDWER-12:
Loosing weight rapidly in the begging is quite common. All of it is not the body weight. One looses weight initially for two reasons: 
1. There is food in transit in our G-I tract, when you fast you lose that weight. This can be as much as 3-5 pounds. 
2. The salt in our food makes the water level in blood plasma high. When we fast the absence of salt, reduces the water content of blood and weight goes down. This can be about one pound depending upon your diet prior to fasting. 
It is for these reasons one looses weight rapidly initially. The true weight loss is rarely over half to three quarter pound a day. 

QUESTION-13:
Do you recommend break days from walking/exercises or is it better to push oneself to continue walking/exercise every single day?
 Will excessive walking lead to knee and other problems?

ANSWER-13:
For walking you do not need a break day in fact I double on the weekends. For stress exercises break day is good. Excessive walking doesnâ€™t lead to knee problems. Sedentary lifestyle does. 

QUESTION-14:
What is your views on extreme exercises - Marathon, ultra marathons, triathlons?
ANSWER-14:
Marathons and extreme sports are fine as competitive sports but not for health. 

QUESTION-15:
Few questions on emotional/spiritual well being?
1) A householder or shravak's responsibility is to provide first for his family and later for society. If one gives up desires (vasanas) completely, how can one fulfill the responsibilities of a householder?
2. Is future pre-destined? What is the role of destiny in emotional well-being?
3. How does one embrace an uncertain future?
4. Is there a framework to choose what to keep and what not to keep from our past?
5. How can one be continually taking actions to fulfill one's responsibilities with detachment to outcomes (no desires)?
ANSWER-15:
1. You do what you need to do, to fulfill your duty. Just donâ€™t be attached to the outcomes of those actions. Enjoy the climb, whether you reach the peak is irrelevant. 
2. Your action is not predestined  for you. Once you have acted, how others respond to it is predestined from your vantage point. 
3. One just focuses on what his duty is and acts accordingly. You have to play the hand you are dealt, to the best of your ability unattached to the outcome. 
4. Learn from your past and move on. Always focus on present. Live in the moment. 
5. Do four things:
A. Once you start acting in a detached fashion, no new desires arise and being busy in the moment you donâ€™t have time to ponder over old desires. 
B. Study scriptures and biography of great holy  men and ponder over them. 
C. Have a daily routine of prayer with gratitude. Gratitude comes when you focus on what you have. Anger comes when you focus on what you donâ€™t have. 
D. Meditate regularly. Yoga and Pranayam are precursor to meditation.

QUESTION-16:
Hi Lalitji, if someone has a pet cow and can ensure no processed food is given to the cow, can its milk be consumed?
ANSWER-16;
No. 
It is quite harmful. Protein in milk is known to cause cancer tumor to grow. 
That was first pointed out by two Hyderabad researchers in 1965 by Madhawan and Gopalan. The research findings were so shocking to nutritionists worldwide that Dr. Collin Campbell of Cornell University, wrote to the publisher, saying that there data must have switched. He replicated the research at his own lab at Cornell and found it be true. It is a landmark finding in the field of nutrition and many scientist are still having problem reconciling with it. Of course for Dr. Collin Campbell it has brought the World fame and he is considered the numero uno of nutrition field in the world today. It is so unfortunate that world has not even heard the names of Madhvan and Gopalan. 
The protein is very harmful for kidneys also. 
The fat which is saturated, is also very harmful for cardio vascular diseases.

QUESTION-17:
What should be the split of protein, fat and carbs. 
ANSWER-17:
Protein and fat should be minimum 5%. So carbs can be upto 90%. But when your diet is PBWF such counting is unnecessary. PBWF protein is not harmful. 
PBWF fat is also not harmful. If you are eating foods in natural form (unprocessed or minimally processed) the need for counting calories goes away. You body and tastebuds become your guide and they are much better than any nutritionist can guide you. Every individual is different. 
Of course this presumes that your body has gotten rid of addictions and is finely tuned. It may take 6 months or so to get there. In the mean time use following guideline of 10:10:80 or 10:20:70.

QUESTION-18:
Coming back to the question of animal protein you had said that 5% is okay. 
If we look at a 2000 calorie diet, 5% is 100 cals... Protein at 4 cals per gram we can take 25 grams. A couple of eggs and milk with tea plus dahi would fall within this range. 
Can we then eschew going to extremes and focus on reducing fat as a first step in our dietary change.
Your comments much appreciated.
ANSWER-18:
It is important to understand that if your total protein consumption is under 5% animal protein will not lead to cancer growth. This 5% figure is including all other proteins that you may be consuming in other foods that day. So if you are stranded in wilderness with no other food, may be few apples and tapioca, then consuming couple of eggs and some milk may be okay. I suspect during evolution this is how we Indians survived as a society. During some famine when no food was available some people tried consuming cow and goat milk and they survived, while others perished.  (I am speaking of only India where our religious beliefs had told us never to kill any
animals, even if you are on the death bed).
On a separate note animal fat is also harmful, so you may not die of cancer but you may die of heart disease by the time you reach 60 which at those times might have been considered a long life lived.
