# Synopsis of Week-1

We have completed one week and the following summarizes what we have covered so far:

1. Diet and lifestyle are the root cause of all chronic illnesses. When we change them chronic illnesses get cured. 
2. At the cellular level only two things matter; deficiency and toxicity. Once we address them the illness goes away. 
3. There are [five pillars of health](./five_pillars_of_health.md); food, detoxification, physical activity, emotional support and spiritual balance. Of these food and detoxification are by far the most important. 
4. There are many myths about food some long held beliefs and some propagated by self serving lobbyists of food, drug or health care industries. 
5. Of these myths the worst is the [myth about protein](./protein_myth.md). Proteins are made with amino acids and only plants make amino acids using water and sunlight. All animals get their protein from plants or from eating animals who eat plants.
6. Recommended [guidelines](./diet_and_lifestyle_guidelines.md) for diet and lifestyle.
7. Discussion about importance of [fiber as nutrient](./fiber_as_nutrient.md). 
8. Why [dairy is very harmful](./milk_and_dairy_products.md) and should be avoided. Dairy is not a good source of calcium. 
9. The typical vegetarian meal plan of Indians is very unhealthy as bulk of the calories come from three unhealthy foods; sugar, oil and dairy. They create deficiencies in micro nutrients. 
10. Consuming refined oil and animal fats are very unhealthy. Omega-3 and 6 fats are essential and need to be consumed daily but in proportion. 
11. Some recommendations for the [healthy meal](./daily_meal_plan.md) ideas were shared. 
12.As it is difficult to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetable, [juicing](./green_juicing.md) is a convenient way to consume them. 

We will spend next week continuing with the discussion about food; the first pillar of health. Macro and micro nutrients; role of antioxidants. Should one take supplements? Acidic vs alkaline foods. How much water, salt, soya and gluten? Best ways to cook food, choice of cookware etc.
