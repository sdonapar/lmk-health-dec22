# Tulsi, Moringa or What?

One of the most frequently asked questions is about a practice of taking something or other with the morning water. 
Or eating it empty stomach or first thing in the morning before or after morning water. 
Every plant based whole food has some benefits. It is misleading to look at them in isolation. I know it is very common in India to take something or other thinking of it as super food. Specially social media is full of such advice 
Obviously any food will have some vitamin or other and some mineral or other. So just because you read about it in social media doesnâ€™t necessarily mean it is superior over others. 

Also the problem with the advise is that only one thing can be consumes empty stomach or first thing in the morning; so what do you do if you have been advised to take multiple things as first thing in the morning. Some people solve that problem by mixing together these into one paste and then consume them empty stomach. To make the taste more palatable they add honey to it. 

I have nothing against taking these but take them as food and not as supplements. To think that they will make up for deficiencies in your diet or lifestyle is wrong. Here are some examples that I often come across:
1. Lemon Water
2. Apple cider vinegar 
3. Jeera water 
4. Tulsi 
5. Methi seeds
6. Aamla extract 
7. Turmeric, 
8. Cinnamon 
9. Curry leaves
10. Moringa 
11. Ginger extract 
12. Garlic 
13. Trifla 
I can keep on going. 
My recommendation is to eat them all but make them part of your recipe and stop taking them as supplements first thing empty stomach in the morning or last thing before going to bed. Take them during your eating window and not during fasting window. 
I will write a separate post on antioxidants and herbs and spices.
