# EMOTIONAL HEALTH

The fifth pillar of health is Emotional & Spiritual Health. 
Pursuit of happiness is the main preoccupation of all living organisms from a single cell to the largest blue whale. At human level we had thought for over a century that happiness is experienced at the brain level and the whole field of psychology evolved to understand the malfunctions of the mind. The recent research has shown that this is not true and each and every cell in the human body is searching for happiness and compensates under conditions of adversity. 

We all have heard stories of positive thinking and mind over matter. Every cell in our body is a living organism and behaves as if it has a mind of its own. The Nobel prize in physiology for 2017 was awarded to J.C.Hall, M. Rodash and M.W.Young for research that showed how our circadian clock works at the cellular level. The Nobel prize for 2019 was given to W. G. Kaelin, G.L. Semenza and P.J. Ratcliff for research that demonstrates how each cell responds to the level of oxygen in our blood. 

Hormones determine our emotional health and emotions determine the functioning of our endocrine glands that release hormones. This interdependence plays major role in our health, and science has only scratched the surface so far. There is lot more to be learned about it. 

PLACEBO & NOCEBO EFFECT
We have known about the placebo effect for over hundred years and the whole field of homeopathy relies on it. Placebo in Latin  means “I shall be acceptable or pleasing”. When we take a pill that is given to us as medicine we get cured even if the pill only had sugar in it. Obviously the sugar did not cure the illness it is the conscious belief, that I will be cured now, that heals the body. The reverse of it is called Nocebo. and has only recently captured the imagination of researchers. Nocebo in Latin means “I shall cause harm”. A negative thought is equally powerful as a positive thought is, in affecting our body but in opposite direction. If you believe that something bad is going to happen to you, it is quite likely that it would happen. The whole concept of curse or Shrap in Hindu mythology works on that principle. 
Happy people have happy thoughts that lead to healthy bodies. The emotions of sorrow and self pity lead to poor health.

CONCEPT OF RASAS
In our younger days, we had learned about the concept of  various rasas  (moods) in Hindi literature. These were:
1.Shanti: peace
2.Bhakti: devotion
3.Karuna: pathos
4.Hasya: laughter
5.Sringaar: love, romance, beauty 
6.Veer: courage and bravery
7.Adbhut: wonderment
8.Raudra: anger
9.Bhayanak: fear
10.Vibhatsya: hatred

We now know that these feelings impact the functioning of our hormonal glands which release different hormones into blood affecting our physical health. This is what we mean by power of positive thinking and negative thinking. 

RESEARCH FINDINGS 
It is widely accepted now that Laughter is the best medicine. We have heard this time and again but what we may not realize is that every single emotion has an impact on our body or in other words all feelings have physical consequences. Here are some examples which all have been proven by various studies:

- When we are in love even water tastes sweet. Love is also a potent pain killer. Being in love also improves memory. 
- Anger leads to insomnia. Anger  increases blood circulation to lymphs and heart which in turn doesn’t let you fall asleep. Anger also results in high BP, Heart disease, Diabetes and a weak immune system. 
- Powelessness makes everything feel heavy.
- Loneliness and sadness makes people feel cold. It also increases appetite and makes one gain weight. 
- Feeling offended can cause Acne.
- Disgust upsets stomach.
- A fit of giggles can reduce stress hormone level. 
- Laughter reduces the stress hormone which reduces the risk of heart attack. 
- Jealousy, a mix of anger, stress and fear, increases adrenal level increasing heart rate and blood pressure and weakening the immune system. 
- Crying gets rid of stress chemicals (but not tears due to onion chopping). When we suppress tears we ruin digestion and weaken immune system. 
- Fear makes us pale because it sends blood to muscles to fight or flight. 
- Praising your partner lowers your cholesterol level. 
- Shame increases stress hormone cortisol which can constrict arteries and increase one’s heart rate. 
- Arguing produces more Cytokins which can slows down healing process. High levels of Cytokins can lead to cancer, heart disease and arthritis.
- Short term stress can strengthen immune system and help fight cancer but chronic stress can impair memory and even lead to diabetes and heart disease. 

HAPPINESS CHEMICALS
There are four primary chemicals in our body  that effect happiness: dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins.

* DOPAMINE is the feel good hormone which is released when we eat food we desire or when we have sex. However, that is a big misconception. Dopamine is actually involved more with ‘anticipation’ than the actual ‘happiness’ feeling. It boosts mood motivation and attention and helps regulate emotional responses. It is also described as a striving emotion.

* OXYTOCIN  is the neurochemical that has allowed us to become social creatures. It makes us feel empathy, which helps us feel close and bonded to others when it’s released. Oxytocin is made in the hypothalamus part of our brain and stored in the pituitary gland. 

* SEROTONIN is the hormone that helps regulate mood and social behavior, appetite and digestion, sleep, memory and sexual desire and function. A link is also suspected between serotonin and depression. 80 percent of serotonin exists in the gut, and is governed by one’s state of hunger (yes, this is why you’re hungry).

* ENDORPHINS act as analgesics, which means they diminish the perception of pain or discomfort. This  explains their association with the “fight or flight” response. When it comes to desiring happiness, endorphins help you “power through.” For example Endorphins allow a runner to push farther and harder as he works towards his goals.

Some of the natural ways  to boost Happiness  hormones are:
* Listening to Music
* Eating Carbs
* Spending Time with loved ones
* Physical Exercise and Yoga
* Pranayama
* Meditation
* Prayers
* Helping others by doing social work

GEETA’S  TEACHINGS
The whole discussion in Geeta about the three types of personalities (gunas); Satwic (purity), Rajsic (passion) and Tamsic (inertia) makes sense. The whole chapter 14 of Bhagvad Geeta is devoted to this subject. In Ayurveda also people are classified into three main types; Vata, Pitta and Kapha. In western medicine they now recognize that people can be divided into three types, depending upon their gut microbiome. I am not saying they are same. I am only making a point that the differentiations among types of people is finally gaining acceptance. Our gut- brain connection is now well recognized and gut is now even called the second brain. 
Our diet and lifestyle affects the hormonal balance in our body, which in turn affects our psyche and actions. This is covered in some capacity in all religious scriptures. I quote here verse 5 from Chapter 14.

“Sattva (purity), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia) - these gunas (qualities), O Arjun, are born of Prakrti (nature) and they bind the indestructible soul (consciousness within us) to the body”.

This is my favorite subject and as you can see I am passionate about it having spent 15 years under tutelage of Swami Chinmayananda.
