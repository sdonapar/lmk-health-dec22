# HOW MUCH SALT?

There is lot of confusion about the role of salt in maintaining good health. There have been conflicting studies. Though beneath the surface there is some consensus. The following summarizes the view of Dr. John McDougall, one of my mentors :

Many doctors find an easy escape goat in salt, blaming many chronic problems on consumption of excessive salt. 

There is a wide divergence amongst people from different parts of the world in their natural salt consumption. It varies from less than 200mg. daily among Yanomamo Indians living in the Amazon Basin of Brazil to 27,000 mg among farmers in Northern Japan. Average American consumes about 3,500 mg of salt a day. 

People who eat natural plant based whole food diet are healthy irrespective of their salt consumption. Research has shown that these same people, when moved to city environment and subjected to modern western diet, develop Hypertension and other chronic diseases. 

Human tongue is by design a sugar and salt seeker having these taste buds on the very tip of the tongue. However human body has a natural ability to regulate the salt. This happens in intestines which can increase or decrease the sodium absorption and kidneys which can increase or decrease the loss of salt into urine and sweat. 

Several large studies conducted within the last decade have concluded that there is a low correlation between salt intake and Cardio Vascular Disease and there might even be a reverse correlation. Among people who have Hypertension, reducing salt intake as a means to reduce HT, may even be associated with higher Cardio Vascular Diseases.
So where is the culprit ? 
The culprit is the company salt keeps.  

THE PROCESSED FOOD
The bacon, ham, salami, chips, fries, pizza, bagels, cheese, ice cream and in India the Haldiram namkin are the culprits. 

In US 75% of the salt in diet comes from processed foods. 
It is almost impossible to eat a low salt diet if you are eating standard animal food based diet. Meat does not taste good without salt and most chickens sold have been injected with saline water. Try eating salt free cheese or boiled lamb, pork or chicken. Animal food is so bland that you need to put salt and lot of it to make it palatable. 

When you eat fruits and vegetables, beans and rice, nuts and seeds there is minimal salt needed to make food tasty and that is where the secret lies. We must avoid processed and refined foods and stop worrying about salt. Keep a salt shaker on your dining table. It wonâ€™t hurt.
