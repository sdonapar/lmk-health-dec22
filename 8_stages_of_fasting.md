# 8 Stages of Fasting

Every cell in the human body is genetically programmed for two main functions (1) self preservation and (2) procreation. 
During plenty of food (fed state), it is less worried about preservation and it is preoccupied with procreation. It is very similar to human behavior; which truly is just the composite of 30 trillion cell’s behavior. During shortage of food body’s focus shifts to preservation. 

The first thing to run out is sugar which is stored as glycogen in muscles and liver. The total storage capacity is 500 grams (2,000 calories), 100 in liver and 400 in muscles. This usually takes about 12 hours to exhaust. When body runs out of sugar in liver, it starts to convert fat into ketone bodies to provide energy to the brain. This stage is called ketosis. The body can stay in ketosis for a very long time and the longest record for water fasting is 382 days. 

When body runs out of protein, it begins to recycle the waste protein sitting inside each cell’s trash can (lysosome) and recycles it into amino acids (which are the building blocks of protein). After some time the body begins to recycle the dead and damaged cells for protein. The process also extends to Senescent cells which are not quite dead but have stopped reproducing. 

The body goes through various stages; some of which are a step curve as in intermittent fasting but others lie on a continuum. Also, when a stage is triggered, is a function of meal (or two) before you start fasting. If the last meal was low in carbs the metabolic shift to ketosis would happen sooner. If the last meal was low in protein the autophagy would trigger earlier. 

The following describes the various stages human body goes through while fasting. The gap in hours is only an approximation as actual would vary from individual to individual, depending upon their gut microbiome and content of the meals prior to fasting. 

(1) 12 hrs: Ketosis: As glycogen in the liver is exhausted, the metabolic pathway shifts to fat burning mode called Ketosis. During ketosis the fat from fat cells is released to provide fuel for the body, as liver converts these fat cells into ketone bodies to provide energy to the brain. During this stage the metabolic rate increases as if body is nudging you to go find food. This is what is typically achieved during daily Intermittent fasting. The higher metabolic rate helps lose excess fat. 

(2) 18 hrs: As ketone bodies level in the blood rises, it signals the body to ramp up stress busting pathways to reduce inflammation and repair DNA damage. 

(3) 24 hrs: Autophagy (Intracellular): At 24 hours cells start recycling protein waste kept in a trash container inside every cell (called lysosome).

(4) 36 hrs: Autophagy (Intercellular): As further time passes the body also begins to recycle damaged cells like senescent cells and misfolded proteins.

(5) 48 hrs: Growth Hormones reach the highest levels (almost 5 times as high as before the fast). This is because hunger hormone Ghrelin promotes the growth hormone secretion.

(6) 54 hrs: Insulin levels drop to the lowest point. The body becomes more insulin sensitive.

(7) 72 hrs: Breakdown of old immune cells and generation  of new ones. Helps build cancer immunity. During this stage (as per Dr. Valter Longo of USC) cancer cells are weakened and more susceptible to chemotherapy while normal cells become more resistant to chemo therapy. 

(8) Refeeding Stage: This stage is very important and often misunderstood. The refeeding should be done slowly and some suggest that food should be gradually increased to normal levels over a duration half as long as the fasting period. More research is needed in this area as human studies to date are quite limited. 

When human body is deprived of Autophagy by staying for ever in fed state, the neurons cells in the brain get damaged causing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and others. It is for these reasons the experts like Dr. Tasuku Honzo and Dr. James P. Allison recommend that one should do a 10 day prolonged fast each year. It does not have to be water only fast; one can eat one meal a day of under 500 calories. It helps if the meals are light on protein as protein deficiency is the main cause of therapeutic benefits. It so happens that there is a custom in many cultures to observe such fasts. Navratri among Hindus and Ramdan among Muslims. Unfortunately to avoid discomfort people have started making too many concessions which negate the benefits of such fasts.
