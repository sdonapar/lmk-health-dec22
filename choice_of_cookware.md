# Choice of Cookware

There are many different types of cooking utensils in the market. The best cooking surfaces are:

1. Cast Iron for Indian food and Chinese style stir frying. 
2. Glass for baking and microwaving.
3. Terracotta for water based cooking requiring long simmering. 
4. Stainless Steel pressure cookers.
5. Ceramic coated (should not be over heated).

And the worst cooking surfaces are:
1. Teflon and other non-stick coated.
2. Aluminum
3. Copper

Some common sense should be maintained while cooking. 
â€¢ do not roast dry spices on coated cookware
â€¢ Do not overheat and then add water to ceramic surfaces
â€¢ Many part time hired cooks use high heat to save cooking time. Do not give them coated utensils. Here is a video on the subject.ðŸ‘‡
