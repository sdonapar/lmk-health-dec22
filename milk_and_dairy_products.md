# Milk & Dairy Products

Research by two Indian scientists from National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad: Gopalan and Madhawan in 1967 had demonstrated that protein found in cow’s milk (Cassein) causes cancer cancer tumors to grow rapidly. This research was most counterintuitive to the prevailing wisdom at the time and surprised the scientific community worldwide. Dr. Collin Campbell whose PhD thesis was on importance of animal protein for human development even wrote to the editor suggesting that by mistake the data might have been switched. He was told otherwise and he later replicated the study and found the findings to be true. This led him to totally reverse his own thesis and his life’s work now is based on this discovery. Today he is renowned for this hallmark research, as the number one nutritionist in the world (Gopalan and Madhawan have been reduced to a footnote). 
In the documentary Forks over Knives this subject has been covered in great detail by Dr. Campbell. 
Humans are the only creatures on earth who consume (1) milk of another species and (2) who continues to consume milk beyond infancy. 
I do not know how it got started. I suspect it happened thousands of years ago, during a period of famine, when people were dying of hunger. Some body tried drinking cow’s milk and survived. From then on it must have become a common practice and led to domestication of cows. 
I must confess that this is one topic where I felt most conflicted. All doctors in the current PBWFood movement are opposed to consuming dairy and there are numerous studies that justify that but Ayurveda, Indian cultural heritage and ancient wisdom recommends it strongly. 
Most recommendations of PBWF doctors are compatible with Ayurveda with few exception like milk and Ghee. 

The milk today is not the same as milk our ancestors consumed. Here are some observations:
1. The way the cows are raised in today’s industrialized world is very different from even 50 years ago in India. Some key differences are:
* The dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination. 
* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.
* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield and 
* They are injected with high dosages of antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions. All these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk they produce and are very harmful to human health. 
2. The indigenous varieties of cows in India (ones with a hump on their back) produce milk (A2) which is genetically different and lower in fat content, besides some other differences. This milk is less harmful than buffalo milk but harmful never the less. 
3. In olden periods there were few carcinogens in the environment and cancer diseases were rare. So even if Casein was consumed in diet, it didn’t result in ill health.
4. The life expectancy in olden days was low and age of 75-80 was considered long life. Very few lived beyond that (I am not talking about puranic period where there are stories of people living for 400 years). Today we are talking about increasing life expectancy of retired people (over 65) to 100+ years. In Blue Zones around the world like Okinawa Japan, Sardinia Italy and Loma Linda California, many people live to be 100+.
I have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Esselston, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Gregor. They all are against consuming milk or milk products in today’s world. Dr. Collin Campbell conceded that if total protein in diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay, as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows. Total protein intake of 8% (from all sources) is the cutoff point where tumor begins to grow. What this essentially means is that during periods of famine, the milk would not be harmful. 

Why No Dairy?
All mammals produce milk at the time of infant birth and nurse their infants for a short period that varies from species to species. The composition of the milk is commensurate with the growth rate of the specie’s infants. Duration of pregnancy varies among various mammals and ranges from 20 days in a mouse to 645 days for an African elephant. Cow is pregnant for 9 months. A new born calf weighs about 70 pounds and doubles its weight within 2  months and matures within 2 years to a weight of over 1,000 pounds. That is a 14 fold growth in 2 years. In comparison a human infant doubles his weight in 4-6 months and matures in 12-14 years. Due to these differences in growth rates the composition of cow’s milk is very different than human milk. It has higher levels of protein and fat. It also has higher levels of growth hormones like IGF-1 (Insulin like Growth Factor-1). This hormone promotes rapid growth. 
Milk may have served a purpose in older times when we faced periods of famine regularly and may have saved many communities from perishing. 
Even modern research has shown that milk when consumed in communities where there is shortage of food, can play a positive role but such cases are rare indeed in today’s civilized world. 
Here are various reasons why milk and other dairy products are unhealthy for humans.
1. There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries like Africa which have lowest rate of milk consumption have lowest rate of osteoporosis. Whereas countries consuming maximum milk have highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers. 
2. Dairy consumption increases body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks. 
3. According to a 2006 study of Harvard researchers, in which 10,000 women aged 26-46, participated, women who consumed most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy products consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer. 
4. Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body. 
5. Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body. 
6. Milk and cheese can cause acne. 
7. Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases. 
8. Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome. 
9. Dairy is a cause of auto immune diseases like arthritis.
10. Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant. 
11. Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes. 
12. Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation. 
13. Other problems associated with dairy are allergies and sinus issues. 
14. Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet. 
Here are some additional points that support my view against dairy. 
* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and  even headaches after giving up dairy. 
* Dr. Neil Bernard had filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and he won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order. 
* US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in it’s dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard school of public health is one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and has called them “utterly ridiculous”.
* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia. 

So this is how I have resolved this conflict it in my life. I do no drink milk or eat milk products on daily basis. I consume  small amount of cultured yogurt occasionally (with khitchri, pulao, or Kadhi). I eat on average 1/2 scoop of ice cream per month to make my grand kids happy. In essence what I am saying is that use milk products as exception only. 
You have to make your own exceptions. Once you are off all medications and reasonably healthy you can make some exceptions. But if you are like Bill Clinton with open heart surgery and multiple stents or you are suffering from stage 2/3 cancer please refrain totally.
