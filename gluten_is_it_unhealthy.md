# GLUTEN; Is it Unhealthy?

I want to discuss the issue of Gluten now  as there is lot of confusion about gluten. There are many articles floating around in media including two best seller books on the subject; Wheat Belly and Grain Brain.
In Indian media also there was an article with the heading 
“Chapatis will become obsolete”. 

Have you ever wondered why wheat, which was eaten for over 10,000 years has all of a sudden become unhealthy and unfit for human consumption. 
There is an auto immune disease  caused by gluten, called Celiac disease. It affects less then one in one thousand people each year. If you are suffering from it you should avoid gluten. 
That gluten is unhealthy is a myth and  has been debunked by many PBWF doctors. The problems assigned to gluten are caused by two factors:
1. The wheat in America has been genetically modified and has higher amount of gluten in it. Many people have problems with American wheat but experience no problem in Europe or India. In India also now some wheat is GMO. 
2. The way wheat is harvested in US and some other advanced countries is by spraying fields with a chemical called Roundup which makes the crop dry evenly so that large Combine machines can be used to harvest and process wheat in a single step. This is the same chemical that people use to get rid rid of weeds from their lawns. Roundup has been shown to cause many health problems including cancer. The company has lost several lawsuits and many are pending in higher courts. 

Having clarified that, I want to emphasize that the low carb movement, which includes Dr. Atkins diet and books like Wheat Belly and Grain Brain are deliberately confusing and are based on lies. 
I do want to warn the readers that there is a huge lobby that has vested interest in promoting low carb diets. Also labeled as Keto diets. All animal food is low carb, high fat and high protein.
This is a terrible diet and kills people in later years. 
Both books have been debunked by most doctors in the Plant Based Whole Food movement. 
Every now and then you hear about a new low carb movement and many people fall for it. It has big support of meet, poultry and dairy industries. 
Almost five decades ago Dr. Atkins with his book“Dr. Atkin’s Diet”, started this line of thinking. According to him if you only eat fat and protein and no carbs you will loose weight. People in America fell for it because it sanctioned their bad behavior. Dr. Atkins made it into his career writing two more books. When he died of many cardiac and other complications in 2002 at the age of 72 he weighed over 300 pounds. If his diet was so good why couldn’t he apply it on himself. 
Then this movement resurfaced as Paleo Diet. The argument here was that our ancestors were hunters and they ate mostly meet and till 10,000 years ago there was very little grain. This was debunked because studies show that our ancestors were more gatherers and scavengers than hunters. Hunting tools evolved much later. Analysis of fossilized poop of Paleo people has shown that meat was less than 5% of their diet.  
Then came these two books and current craze is Low Cab Keto diets. 
All these diets are heavily supported by the food industry and there is big money behind it and they get tremendous media coverage. 
It is human nature. 
“WE LOVE TO READ GOOD THINGS ABOUT OUR BAD HABITS”
I urge all to not fall for it.
