# FAT:YES  BUT NO OILS

This is the hardest guideline for Indians to comply. Practically all Indian recipes begin with pouring oil (ghee is butter oil) in the pot or pan. 
There seems to be lot of confusion and misunderstanding  and misleading articles on social media, google and YouTube. Most of these suffer from the same confusion as I discussed in my earlier post titled “Healthy vs Unhealthy”.
Many terms you come across are:
1. Hydrogenated fats or Trans fats 
2. Saturated fats
3. Monounsaturated fats
4. Polyunsaturated fats 

The other differentiation is based on the length of the Chain of carbon atoms:  
1. Short chain
2. Medium chain 
3. Long chain
4. Extra long chain

As you can see, if we multiply the two types, their can be 16 different types of fats. It is not my intention to discuss these. All I want say is that our body is good at making fat and it convert all extra calories into fat to be stored in fat cells under our skin and around internal organs (known as visceral fat). There are only two fats our body can not make Omega-3 and Omega-6 and that is why they are called essential fats. 
To make things easy to understand and remember, I want you to learn that there are only four types of fat. 
1. Great fats: Flaxseed, Chiaseed and Walnuts
2. Good fats: Plant based Whole Foods like avocado and nuts
3. Bad fats: Animal Food, eggs and Dairy
4. Killer fats: Trans Fats

Trans fats are the worst kind of fats we can consume. This is when vegetable oil is converted  into saturated fat by hydrogenating it. It is also called vegetable shortening and was sold as Dalda in India for many decades beginning in 1937. This product has now been banned in the US and many European countries. It is the worst food product for human health. 

It is important to differentiate between fats and oils. Plant based fats in natural form, are embedded in fibers and are healthy for the body. Fats provide energy as they are released from the fibers over time. During this time the body is also spending energy so a balance is maintained without raising the level of triglycerides in the blood. When oil is consumed, it quickly gets absorbed in the blood, increasing its triglycerides level. High triglycerides level causes body to store fat in fat cells. That is why it is said “the fat you eat is the fat you wear”. It really applies to refined fat meaning oil and ghee. Natural fat is found in all plant based foods. Rich sources are nuts and seeds. Avocado is unique in its fat composition as it is 80% fat and therefore very useful for PBWF diet recipes. (You can mix them in dough to make oil free rotis and stuffed parathas).
Peanuts and coconuts are also very rich in fat and very healthy; you should use them freely in your cooking but not their oils. 

It has lately become fashionable in India to eat olive oil. People ask me about eating olive oil in salads and they talk of extra virgin olive oil. Please note that all olive oils are unhealthy no matter how many virgins are attached to it. Olive oil is not stable at high temperatures so can not be used for Indian cooking. Considering that, if you are a healthy individual, spending your budget of two teaspoons a day (as discussed in my post earlier), why would you want to waste that on salad dressing. The only reason for making an allowance is, so that Indians can at least make some indian style vegetable (subji) dishes.

Another question that often gets asked is “Isn’t it true that we need some fat with green salads to absorb the nutrients well?” The answer is yes you need some fat but no oil. Firstly all greens have some fat in them and secondly you should add avocados, nuts and seeds to your salad and not oil. Even boiled chickpeas can be added as they are rich in fat. They also make good hummus.

If one must use oil, I recommend butter oil (ghee) or mustard oil as they have the best (lowest) ratio of Omega-6 to omega-3. Consumption of omega-6 in disproportionately high amounts is very harmful. 
Mustard Oil: US government does not approve of mustard oil as in their opinion, it has not been tested sufficiently on humans. It is a different matter that we Indians have eaten it for thousands of years. There is lot of politics in food. We will cover that in detail separately during week 4. 
Canola Oil (can in canola stands for Canada) is made from a seed of the same family as mustard. It is highly refined. All oils are unhealthy. 
As far as freshly made whole food, nut butter is concerned all are fine; peanut, walnut, pecan, cashew, almond.

How to wean off oil and  increase compliance to PBWF ?Here I have listed some practical suggestions. 
1. Use freshly made nut butters and coconut butter (not oil).
2. Those who have maids at home, who do the cooking, should try mixing some water in their mustard oil and ghee. Tell the maid that this is a special liquid given by the doctor to add to the oil/ghee and the bottle should be mixed thoroughly before taking out oil. She can continue with her recipes but the total oil/ ghee consumption will go down. You can start with 50/50 mixture and later increase the percentage of water. 
3. Other approach is to calculate the total allowance for the month and give only that much oil/ghee on the first of each month and tell her that she must stretch till the end of the month. So for a family of 3 at two teaspoons a day it comes to one oz per day or 30 oz (840 ml) per month. 
These approaches have been tried by members in the previous groups successfully.

It is also important that we change our vocabulary and stop thinking in terms of cooking and replace that word with “preparing”. Ask yourself what am I going to prepare tonight instead of cooking.
