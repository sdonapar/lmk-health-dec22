# 1.13 Five Pillars of Health 

There are several factors that determine our health. I call them the five pillars of health. These are: 
1. Food
2. Detoxification
3. Circadian Rhythm 
4. Physical Activity
5. Emotional & Spiritual Health

Out of these food (including absence of it, as in fasting), accounts for two third of the health and the rest of the remaining factors account for the remaining one third. This may come as surprise to many because social media is full of articles and talks which suggest other factors like physical exercise or yoga & meditation as most important. There are many such myths. Food provides us nutrition and energy and I will initially focus on food.
