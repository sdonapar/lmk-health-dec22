# PHYSICAL  ACTIVITY

The fourth pillar of health is physical activity. An inactive lifestyle ranks as number five in terms of risk factors for death and number 6 in terms of risk factors for disability. Dietary risks and smoking are the top two factors for both these risks. The  diet is the 800 pound gorilla in the room when it comes to health but after diet, detoxification, circadian rhythm, physical activity is the fourth most important factor for good health. 
Exercise helps in areas such as mental health, cognitive health, sleep quality, cancer prevention, diabetes management, CVD, immune function, high blood pressure and lifespan extension. 

The question that follows is ideally how much should one exercise. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans issued by the US Government recommend only 150-300 minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise which is consistent with previous recommendation which advised at least 30 minutes per day, by the Surgeon General. 
Often these advisories fall victim to a frame of mind that, “why advise some thing which would not be followed”. So they tone down their advice to what they think is achievable rather than informing us what the science says. It is also very common in issuance of dietary guidelines.
I will not dwell too much on this subject. Most of you are aware of importance of exercise. My goal is to cover some basic minimum activities and exercises essential for good health. 

1. Research shows that more you walk the lesser is your all cause mortality rate. Walking 90 minutes a day is better than walking 60 minutes a day which in turn is better than walking 30 minutes a day. Walking facilitates the flow of lymphatic fluids from our lymph nodes which are near our underarms and upper leg joints. 

There are certain parts of the body where their are no blood vessels like the inter vertebrae discs separating our back bones. The only way they get nutrition and excrete waste is through a spongy process. When they are compressed the waste is excreted and when they expand the fresh nutrients are absorbed. Every time we take a step this cycle repeats. Many media articles questioning the wisdom of 10,000 steps totally miss this point. Walking can also be replaced by skipping ropes or climbing steps up and down. One point I want to make is that stepping down is also beneficial so those who have hard time climbing up many floors can climb down the stairs and then take the elevator up. 

2. The speed of walking is important from cardiac workout point of view. I recommend a pace of 110-130 steps per minute. The body should achieve a stress level of 85% of it’s maximum capacity for some duration during the day. The way to compute our maximum pulse capacity is to subtract our age from the number 220. That gives us the maximum pulse rate. So for a 70 year old the maximum pulse rate is 150. It should be once goal to achieve 85% of that maximum for at least 5 minutes twice daily. 

3. The third factor to consider is that we should not sit for long durations. The research has shown that sitting for long periods is almost as harmful as smoking. 
To cover the first three points I recommend five minutes of activity for every waking hour of the day. And two five minute sessions of cardiac workout where your pulse reaches the 85% of your capacity. That adds up to about 10,000 steps each day. The best way to monitor this is by using a Fitbit or Apple Watch. 

4. Besides walking, it is important to provide movements to our vertebrae to exercise those muscles which are holding the back in place. It is important to do some exercises for the back which cover all four types of movements:
- Forward and backward bend
- Sideways bend to left and right
- Twist in both directions
- Compression and extension
Yoga is the best way to exercise these movements. 

5. It is important for muscles and bone health, to do some stress training. This can be achieved by some basic exercises like: squats, pushups, pull-ups and sit-ups or you can go to gym. 

6. Practice of Pranayama can go a long way in improving and maintaining health. The role of patterns of breathing in health recovery is only now being recognized in the western world as shown by the award of 2019 Nobel Prize in physiology to research that shows how human cells respond to different levels of oxygen. 
7. In certain places the pollution is really bad like Delhi during winter. I suggest that in such situations one should do stationary jog or indoor walking or climbing up or down the stairs. 

To summarize, the active lifestyle is key to good health and it is best to make a routine that can be followed regularly.

There are many factors where the benefits lie on a continuum but to make a point it helps to pick a number. Walking is one such factor. It is fairly well established that more you walk each day the better it is for health. Of course the extreme excess of everything is bad. It is always the law of diminishing returns. The research has shown that one hour walking per day is better than half hour walking per day which is better than 20 minutes each day and even that is better than no walking at all. The research has also shown that one and a half hour walking each day is better than one hour each day. There is no research beyond that. In one and a half hour one covers about 10,000 steps. Separately research has also shown that walking five minutes each waking hour is a good target for activity level. Considering seven hours of sleep time that comes to 85 minutes (17x5). So I recommend five minutes of walking each waking hour. It is a good idea to split that walk into multiple sessions. The study of various Blue Zones around the world where people live the longest disease free life has also shown that the average number of daily steps people walk there is over 13,000. The figure of 10,000 is just a marker to be used as a guide. Playing tennis or badminton or biking or swimming are other options. The target should be one and a half hour of activity per day. The linked video by Dr. Greger discusses some research behind it.
