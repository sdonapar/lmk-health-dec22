# SLEEP: Why it Matters

Almost two out of three people in US don’t get sufficient sleep and it impacts their overall health in ways that we had not imagined earlier. One third of the people sleep 6 hours or less, which is double the rate from 50 years ago. It is recognized as a public health epidemic buy the Center for disease Control (CDC) and an estimated 60 million people in US suffer from chronic sleep disorder. Children are progressively getting less and less sleep per night as each year passes by. In past century they are getting 2 hours less sleep each night. One in five car crashes in US is the result of drowsy driving. Here are some of the things we now know about sleep. 

1. Brain accounts for only 2% of the body’s mass but consumes 25% of the energy. A mesh of blood vessels provides the nutrients and oxygen to every cell of the brain which also produces metabolic waste that needs to be removed regularly. Brain is filled with cerebral spinal fluid into which the cells excrete the waste like Beta Amyloids. This is flushed out during cycles of deep sleep and collected into lymphatic system. Improper sleep causes accumulation of these wastes which lead to diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s. 
2. Besides removing toxins during sleep, brain also repairs and maintenance brain cells, prunes connections, transfers short term memory into long term memories. 
3. Sleep helps with integration of daily learning with prior experiences. Specially perceptual learnings. 
4. Sleep helps replenish energy sources. One of the sensors that tells us that the brain needs more sleep is located on the brain cells. As we use up the energy the brain cells have stored, this sensor builds up the residual part of spent energy called adenosine which gives signal of tiredness. This leads to involuntary transition from wake stage to sleep. This is very dangerous while driving. Some try to fight it by getting caffeine at this stage but it only acts as a temporary blocker of that signal. It does not prevent it. 
5. Lack of sleep affects our ability to concentrate, think logically and to remember. 
6. Brain needs sleep to Maintain focus, attention and alertness. 
7. Lack of sleep increases our reaction times by 3 times which is a leading cause of auto accidents. 
8. When we are sleep deprived we miss visual signals. 
9. Cardio vascular system also depends on sleep. Sleep affects heart, blood pressure and other functions. Sleep deprivation is a known cause of high BP. 
10. Sleep also affects our immune system. Sleep deprived people are susceptible to getting more infections. 
11. It for this reason cancer patients who are sleep deprived are more likely to have tumor growth as body’s immune system is compromised. 
12. Sleep is also responsible for regulation of appetite. Sleep deprivation leads to hunger because historically hunger hormone was a way to motivate us to go out and search for food and not sleep. Nowadays when food is easily available it works against us and as a result sleep deprived people are more likely to overeat. 
13. Sleep deprivation also makes insulin less effective causing sugar levels to rise more. This leads to increase in obesity in type-2 diabetes. There is a strong correlation over past half century between sleep deprivation and increased obesity and diabetes.
14. College students restricted to 4 hours sleep (1-5 AM) per night for 4 nights showed a reduction in glucose clearance rates of 40% and acute insulin response down 30%. They looked like they were diabetic.
15. Surprisingly the analysis of fat cells from sleep deprived people compared to when they were not sleep deprived, show that fat cells from sleep deprived stage have poor glucose response. 
16. Sleep deprivation can reduce vaccination benefits. In a study, one night of sleep deprivation after Hepatitis vaccination resulted in 49% reduction in HPAV antibodies after 4 weeks. 
17. Sleep deprivation affects us emotionally also, causing more anxiety, depression and volatile behavior. 
18. Sleep deprivation is associated with ADHD in children. One in five high school boys in the US is diagnosed with ADHD. 
19. Studies show that sleep deprived people are twice as likely to remember negative words than positive words. This explains some of the marital discords. 
20. It is not only how much you sleep but when you sleep is also important. If sleep cycle is out of sync with the circadian rhythm health problems persist. 
21. So, sleep deficit and misalignment of circadian rhythm are equally responsible. 
22. Sleep Apnea increases the risk of CVD by 420%. 
23. Sleeping less than 6 hours a night increases stroke risk by 4.5 times. 
24. A rare sleep disorder called Fatal Familial Insomnia leads to dementia and death. 
25. Heavy physical labor during day time doesn’t require extra sleep at night. Heavy emotional stress may require more sleep time. 
26. Any thing that increases the core temperature of the body like exercise or hot bath can facilitate sleep. 
27. Awakening during middle of the night is very common and doesn’t constitute disturbed sleep. Historically it was common to wake up once or twice at night. 
28. People who claim to be champion sleepers meaning, I can sleep anywhere any time are mostly sleep deprived. 

HOW MUCH SLEEP?
A typical adult needs 7-9 hours of sleep and an adolescent needs 8-10 hours of sleep. Children need more. There are personal differences, but no adult needs less than 6 hours and any claims to the contrary are only reflection of their ignorance. Adverse effects to sleeping less are well understood but are there adverse health effects of sleeping too much? Over sleeping is not natural. Sleeping over 10 hours a night is abnormal. Studies have shown that subjects who were asked to sleep 14 hours at night could not sleep that much after first few days. Once they have made up for sleep deficit, it is not possible to sleep more and accumulate surplus. Many people who claim to be needing less sleep, when brought under controlled study are surprised to find how their sleep duration expanded when the light and clocks are removed from their environment. 

Health consequences of sleep deficiency include following:
* Higher Inflammation 
* Weight Gain & Obesity
* Diabetes Risk
* Cardio Vascular Disease
* Cancer
* Reduced Immunity
* Hormonal Imbalances
* Lack of Concentration 
* Hyperactivity
* Emotional Instability
* Depression
* Burnout

NAPPING
1. Napping is very beneficial and it can help make up for sleep deficit at night. Hour for hour it is just as effective as sleep at night. However it does not help remove any circadian rhythm imbalances. 
2. When it comes to memory processing, a  90 minute nap is as beneficial as a 6 hour sleep at night. However we don’t have data for immune function, endocrine function, hormonal function, clearance of toxins etc. 
3. Good time to nap is early afternoon and not late afternoon. 
4. If the person wakes up at the time he needs to wake up naturally, he probably gets enough sleep. Does he sleep longer on the weekends ? If so than probably he doesn’t get enough sleep. 

SLEEP DISORDERS
Here is a list of sleeping disorders. 

(1) Insomnia
This refers to difficulty in falling asleep. There can be many causes like
* Acute stress
* Alcohol or caffeine 
* Circadian imbalance
* Medical or neurological factors 
* Psychiatric disorders

(2) Parasomnia
This refers to unusual behavior at night.
* Non REM Parasomnia like sleep walking or nightmares.
* REM Sleep Behavior Disorders

(3) Hypersomnia
Excessive Daytime Sleeping
can be due to any of the following major causes:
* Insufficient quantity of sleep at night
* Poor quality of sleep
* Sleep apnea 
* Pathological disorders like Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Insomnia. 
* Medical or Psychiatric disorders like thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effects or mood disorders. 
* Circadian Rhythm disorders like night shift job and jet lag.

(4) Sleep Related Breathing Disorders: Sleep Apnea

(5) Sleep Related Movement Disorders: Restless Leg Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement

CAUSES OF SLEEP DISORDERS
1. Caffeine and/or alcohol. 
2. Watching blue light emitting screens like TV, computer and cell phones before bedtime. 
3. Eating late dinners after it is dark outside. 
4. Snacking after dinner.
5. One must prepare to sleep by turning off lights and lowering thermostat temperature. 
6. Timing of sleep should be regular. 

As you can see there are many sleep disorders some are clearly due to diet and lifestyle but all may not be. If these persist even after making modifications in diet and lifestyle, one should consult a specialist.
