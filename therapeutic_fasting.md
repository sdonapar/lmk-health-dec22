# Therapeutic Fasting

Those among us who have never fasted find it very difficult to fast for even one day. By the time it is noon one begins to feel famished and all one can think of is food. Fasting as a therapeutic tool has been used in many parts of the world over past 100 years including Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and California. An early book on the subject ‚ÄúThe Fasting Cure‚Äù was written in US by Upton Sinclair in 1911. There are clinics  in Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and California, dedicated to curative healing by fasting. 

Considering that we all have enough fat in our body to last us 6 or more months, have you ever wondered why do we feel famished. There are two reasons:
(1) Firstly we have developed addiction to food  and when we do not get food in time we experience withdrawal symptoms like headaches as in any addiction. 
(2) The second reason is that although our body evolved over millions of years facing feast and famine regularly, the modern man rarely experiences famine,  and finds it very hard to deal with it even for a day. As if our body has forgotten how to burn fat.
Having said all that, I want to assure you that once you start practicing fasting and get over initial hurdle and the mental block, the process becomes very easy. More than 90% people report not feeling hungry, while doing prolonged fasting. I have already introduced to you the concept of intermittent fasting and many have started doing it; now we will talk about other types of fasts for therapeutic purposes. 

HOW DOES HUNGER WORK ?
Hunger has little to do with absence of food in the stomach and more to do with the release of a hormone called Ghrelin. 
Ghrelin is the hunger hormone that comes in waves. It makes us hungry at the same time every day as Ghrelin rises during meal times. This is why during prolong fasting first 2 days are the most difficult. 

BENEFITS  OF  FASTING 
‚Ä¢ Fasting reduces fat mass by going into Ketosis
‚Ä¢ Fasting reduces inflammation, 
‚Ä¢ Fasting reduces triglycerides, 
‚Ä¢ Fasting heals digestive system and guts
‚Ä¢ Fasting lowers insulin, that helps increase insulin sensitivity and cure diabetes 
‚Ä¢ Fasting reduces fatty liver
‚Ä¢ Fasting raises human growth hormone (HGH) and releases brain derived neurotraffic  factor (BDNF). This helps in healing neurological disorders. 
‚Ä¢ Fasting causes autophagy, which is a very powerful detoxing process where by, your body recycles waste protein within cells, dead cells, weaker cells, damaged cells and misfolded proteins. 2016  Nobel prize was awarded to Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi for his research on this subject. 
‚Ä¢ Fasting also lowers PKA enzymes in the body which unleash the ability to form new stem cells. 
‚Ä¢ Fasting induces detoxifying enzyme pathways. This helps detoxification processes to continue even after fasting has been discontinued. 
‚Ä¢ Fasting helps kill cancer cells by building immunity. The 2018 Nobel prize was awarded to Dr.Honzo  for research on this subject. 
‚Ä¢ Fasting not only slows the aging process but also reverses aging. 

FOUR PHASES OF FASTING 
Fasting is a four phase process. 
(1) In the first phase your body slows down the metabolic rate and the activity level. You develop headache and experience withdrawal symptoms. 
(2) In phase two of fasting Glucogon increases which helps burn fat. Your metabolic rate increases and brain releases Alpha waves which encourage relaxation, induce a profound feeling of mental clarity and help achieve an alert state of mind. This is your brain‚Äôs way of telling you to get up and search for food. 
(3) In third phase autophagy starts and it helps clean out the dead and damaged cells.
(4) The fourth stage is during the end of fast and when food is reintroduced. It is called the re-feeding stage. At this stage the growth in new cell‚Äôs happens. It is a very important stage for rejuvenation. 

There are two different approaches to fasting; intermittent and prolonged. 

1. INTERMITTENT FASTING
In Intermittent Fasting one either reduces the eating window to a narrow window of 10 hours or less every day or does 24 hour fasts with caloric reduction (to under 500 calories) twice a week. We have already covered IF in detail under a separate heading. 

2. PROLONGED FASTING
In Prolonged Fasting the fasting period is stretched beyond 24 hours. On the surface it appears difficult but it really isn‚Äôt because one has already gone past the tough period of the first 24 hours. Prolonged fasting has tremendous therapeutic value. In fact it is believed that when all else fails, prolonged fasting is the treatment of last resort. It has been practiced in a few countries including Russia for many years. In California there is a clinic in Santa Rosa called ‚ÄúTrue North Health Center‚Äù where they put patients on supervised water fasts for up to 40 days. I have met the director Dr. Alan Goldhamer. They have been quite successful and work closely with Dr. John McDougall of the PBWF movement. 
During prolonged fasting one must follow these suggestions:
- Add a pinch of Himalayan salt to your water.
- Do not stress out. 
- Do whatever soothes you. Meditation can help. 
- Stay physically active and follow your typical daily regimen.

Prolonged fasting can be done in different ways with varying level of intensity:

A. Liquid Fast: 
In this you can consume water and clear liquid foods like juice and soups. This is truly not a fast but just a detox program. 

B. Fruits Only Fast: 
In this, you water fast for 24 hours and then break your fast with a meal of fruits only. Many Indian religious fasts come under this category, where on the fasting day you skip breakfast and lunch and only eat dinner but that dinner is fruits only; no cereals or beans or starchy vegetables. 

C. Water Fast: 
No food but plenty of water for 24 hours or longer. This fast can be done for long periods and is very therapeutic. The longest water only fast on record is 382 days. 

D. Dry Fast: 
No food or water for 24 hours or longer. It is the most effective way to fast. It is two to three times more effective than water fasting. There are two types of dry fasts; soft and hard. In soft dry fast you can brush your teeth, shower and wash your hands. In hard dry fast you avoid any contact with water. 

How to break a Fast:
When breaking a fast, care should be taken to introduce food slowly. Break your fast with water, juice, fruits and a small meal, in that order. 
Those who are doing dry fasting should bracket their dry fast with water fasting on both ends. A 48 hour dry fast can be bracketed with two 12 hour water fasts making it a 72 hour fast which is as effective as a five day water only fast. This is my personal favorite. 

Extended fasting should be practiced slowly. Those who have been doing intermittent fasting will find it easy to extend fasting window to 24 hrs by skipping breakfast and lunch and eating dinner at the regular time. 
Once you are able to do 24 hr. fast comfortably, you can skip the dinner also and eat at your regular time, breakfast or brunch (whatever is your daily routine). This way you would achieve  40 hrs fast. After that the next step would be to go for 48 hrs, 64 hrs and 72 hrs. I advise against keeping any fast longer than 72 hrs without supervision. 
When you are doing water only fast you would be urinating a lot and it is recommended to add some Himalayan salt to your water. That salt helps maintain the mineral balance. 
People who are suffering serious illnesses should consult their physicians before starting the practice of fasting. 

When we fast for therapeutic purposes and not for weight loss, the goal is to achieve autophagy which starts when body runs out of protein and it also typically starts after 24 hours. Fruits such as apple are the lowest in protein (only 2%). So if the fast is broken by fruits low in protein, even while breaking the fast in the evening the autophagy is maintained for another 12-16 hours till next day‚Äôs breakfast.
