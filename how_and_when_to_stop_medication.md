# How and When to Stop Medications

It has only been three days and I have started receiving enquirers from some members, whether to stop medications. I want to make some clarifications :

1. I am not a doctor. I do not diagnose symptoms. I only diagnose diet and lifestyle. 

2. I can not and will not advise you on medications. That is totally your decision. My goal is to empower you to make such decisions and not to make them for you. I have told you that Dr. John McDougall asks all his patients to stop medications before starting his 10 day live in program at Santa Rosa, California. He does that because changing diet to plant based whole food, reduces your markers rapidly and continuing medication can lead to hypoglycemia amongst diabetic patients. So diabetic patients for sure need to reduce insulin and medications but in consultation with their doctors. 

3. What I coach, in terms of diet and lifestyle, will help improve your symptoms and their markers like BP, Blood Sugar, Cholesterol will improve. As these markers improve you can share them with your doctor and ask if you can reduce or stop medications. Some doctors are of old school and have been led to believe that medications for lifestyle diseases should never be stopped and continued for the whole life. They may advise you against it. In which case you may want to consider a second opinion. 

4. The latest research has shown that controlling symptoms too aggressively for a disease can damage overall health, even though it is keeping in check a particular marker for that particular disease. It is for this reason there is lot of debate in the last decade and many guidelines for aggressive medication are being revised. Not all doctors are aware of these revisions. Also such revisions have led to differences in guidelines for BP or Blood Sugar by different professional medical associations. We will discuss these matters in more detail next month when we discuss each disease in more detail.

5. I am strictly against stopping medications before making dietary changes. I have come across case where people stop medications thinking that from tomorrow they will be on new diet anyway and then that tomorrow gets delayed because they couldnâ€™t decide on the juicer or the sale on the juicer starts only after another week. So dietary changes get delayed. Always make sure that dietary changes precede medication reduction and not the other way round. 

As regards to the pace at which the medications will get reduced; it is a function of your compliance to the guidelines and severity and history of illness. 
I have seen some members reduce their medication by half every week and some more or less aggressively. 
Obviously, if the revised guideline is such that you should never have been on medication in the first place, your doctor would concur to stop medication immediately. For example the revised guidelines for BP are 140/90 for people under age 60 and 150/90 for ages over 60. 
The revised guidelines for Diabetic is A1C of 7.9. So if your A1C is over 8.0 you must continue on medication but if less than you must reduce medication. 

I hope I have clarified some doubts as to how and when to get off medications.
