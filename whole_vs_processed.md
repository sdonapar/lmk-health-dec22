# 1.3 Whole vs Processed 

What one has to consider in reviewing foods is how natural it is and is it whole or refined. Not all Whole Foods are healthy specially if they are highly processed. The idea is to eat least processed food. For example let us talk about corn. The following list summarizes various options available in order of increased processing and refinement. 
1. Corn on the cob (least processed)
2. Frozen corn
3. Corn Meal
4.Whole corn flour 
5. Corn Starch
6. Popcorn 
7. Corn flakes
8. Corn Oil
9, High fructose corn syrup. This is most processed and refined and most harmful. 

The last item here is the most unhealthy. This is what get used in most packaged products to sweeten the taste as it is much cheaper than sugar. Most sugary beverages like Coke and Pepsi use HFCS instead of sugar. It is banned in several European countries. 

Oneâ€™s goal should be to eat least processed and refined food. For example if you have on a buffet table  corn on the cob (Bhutta) and corn tortillas and corn flakes eat Bhutta. Of course if you do not like Bhutta but love tortillas then have tortillas (since they are very close in the grade). But if you say I love corn flakes, the answer would be NO.
