# HOW MUCH WATER ?

There are many posts floating around in the social media on the subject of water; recommending various amounts of water to drink per day. Also how and when to drink water and boasting of curing all kinds of ailments by drinking water.
My goal today is to address this subject and clarify any confusion such posts may have created. 

Mayo Clinic recommends a daily intake 2.7 liter for women and 3.7 liter for men. 
It is true that lack of water can cause or contribute towards ailments, but more often than not, the claims made of curing various illnesses are outlandish and are unsubstantiated. Recently I heard from one cancer patient that he had increased his water consumption to 3 liters per day. There is nothing wrong with this false hope as long as the patient is also doing everything else that he needs to do. (Which in case of this cancer patient would be to stop all angiogenic foods and increase consumption of anti angiogenic foods)

We know that water plays an important role in maintaining certain balances in the body. For example it helps maintain Ph balance and mineral balance. 
If you are a New Yorker living on an unhealthy diet of meat, potatoes coffee and alcohol with no or minimal water, you may develop some ailments. In such a case introduction of water may mitigate the symptoms but that does not mean that all who suffer from that ailment can be cured by increasing water consumption. This is the problem with many claims and many videos you come across on YouTube.

Here are examples of some of the claims (which I neither accept nor refute):
Claims about curing ailments :
1. Acid Reflux
2. Head Aches & Migraine
3. Painful Cramps
4. Adrenal Problems
5. Obesity
6. Constipation 
7. Hyper Tension
8. Kidney Stones
9. Colon Cancer
10. Diabetes 

Claims regarding Benefits of water:
- Improves blood volume and viscosity
- Boosts your energy level
- Flushed out toxins and keeps your organs healthier
- Improves skin
- Promotes weight loss
- Better muscle contraction
- Improvement in hormone production
- Less joint pain
- Reduction of stress hormones

How much water you should drink is a function of your health, activity level, climate and most important diet. This last point does not get much coverage in media and I may be going on a limb to make this claim. I have discussed in previous posts how water helps us maintain alkalinity and also sodium level so it is natural that if you are eating a diet of rich alkaline foods and low sodium (implying unprocessed) you are less likely to require excessive water to flush acidity and/or salt. 

Assuming your climate is 15-25 degree Celsius temperature with dry air (air conditioned environment) and activity level is 10,000 steps a day, a good rule of thumb is 3-5% of your body weight should be consumed in water. So a person who weighs 75 Kilo should drink 2.25-3.75 liter of water every day. Assuming a 250 ml. glass that is 9-15 glasses per day. Now if you are eating  1% of your body weight (as recommended) each in fresh fruits and vegetables a day (which are mostly water, say average 85%) that takes care of 1.7%. So the balance remaining is 1.3-3.3%. That reduces your water requirement to 4-10 glasses per day. Now if you are not eating non-veg and processed foods I would venture to say that 6 glasses per day is sufficient. Have 2 glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, one glass an hour after every meal and one glass before going to bed. For warmer weather of India you should develop a habit of drinking a glass of water every time you return from an outside trip.

It is possible to drink too much water and when you drink too much water you may loose some mineral balance. A good way of assessing your situation is by observing the color of your urine. It should be at level 2 on a scale of clear to dark yellow (scale of 1-5).

PS: Please note that acidic beverages and some bottled water that are acidic do not count towards your total daily intake.
