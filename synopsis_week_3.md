# Synopsis Week-3

We have completed the third  week of our group and the following summarizes what we covered in the past week: 

1. Food is the largest source of toxins in the body. As food is digested and absorbed, the undesired substances and toxins are released in the body and excreted through the daily processes of urination, bowl movement and sweating. 

2. Drinking 2-3 glasses of warm water, first thing in the morning and staying hydrated throughout the day are good detoxing habits.

3. Other sources of toxins come from the environment and the cleaning compounds we use and the lotions and makeup we apply to our body. 

4. Every cell in human body removes toxins which are collected by the blood or the lymphatic system in the body. Unlike blood circulation system, lymphatic system does not have a pump, and relies on the movement of the body for circulation. Daily walking helps lymphatic fluids flow and do its job better. 

5. Detoxing at cellular level involves autophagy, which helps recycle dead, damaged and misfolded protein cells. Fasting for intermittent and extended periods is the best way to achieve this. 

6. The third pillar of health is our circadian rhythm which follows the day and night cycle. When this circadian rhythm is out of sync with the natures day and night cycle, it leads to hormonal imbalances which can cause various chronic health issues. We must avoid eating at night, physical working out at night and watching blue light emitting screens like TV, Computer monitors and cell phones at night without blue light filter. 

7. The fourth pillar of health is physical  activity which is essential for healthy body. One must try to achieve an activity level equivalent to 10,000 steps each day and some cardio activity. 

8. Emotional health and the state of mind, play an important role over physical health and the reverse is true as well. Many hormones affect our moods and happiness. 

9. Regular spiritual practices in a spirit of gratitude also improve health and hormonal balance within our brain.

Moving forward, we will now start discussion on Chronic Diseases. But before we discuss that we will spend one week discussing how the biases emerge in scientific research we take for granted. How the nexus of Health Care, Food and Pharma industries have resulted in short changing us, the consumer, by creating and propagating many myths while the government and the media looks the other way.
