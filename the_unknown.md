# THE  UNKNOWN

There are things we do not know. There are questions that remained unanswered in our childhood and when we grow up we stop asking them, till we have kids of our own. 
My Mom and Dad upon constant query must have said it is too late now, go to sleep. Honestly I don’t remember, but that is what I always told my children. 
Every time we try to understand from the faculties we have (the Body, Mind and Intellect), we keep returning without reaching the answer. The Sages of ours had the same experience and recorded as such in Tattiriya Upanishad.

“Yato vacho nivertante, 
aprapya manas saha .”

“That, from which, my mental faculties keep returning, without reaching.”

When a direct enquiry fails, we look for indirect enquiry. When seeking an unknown answer, we often assign it a name like in a math problem we say let us assume the unknown answer is X, then we apply logic to find the answer and when the answer is found, we say “therefore X is equal to ....”.
Similarly our ancestors decided to call the unknown by a sound symbol “Om”. Now the question was “What is Om? 
Indirect enquiry leads to three answers called the universal laws of causation. 

1. Every effect must have a cause
2. The Effect is nothing but the Cause itself, but in a different form. The examples we give are of different gold ornaments are nothing but the gold nugget found in the gold mine. Or all the pots made by a pottery maker whether the honey pot or the spittoon are nothing but the clay itself. 
3. When the Cause is removed from the Effect, nothing remains. 

The Sages of ours must have realized this, when they wrote Ishavasya Upanishad, because 
the answer appears in the very first verse of this Upanishad. The title of the Upanishad, Ishavasya means the word of GOD. 

“Poornamadah poornamidam poornaat poorna mudachyate,
Poornasya poornmadaye poornmevav shishyate.”

“That is Whole
This is Whole
This Whole manifests from that Whole (and)
When this Whole is removed (negated) from that Whole, what remains is Whole.”

This shloka is considered by many, to be the most important shlokas in Vedanta. It is said that if ever there was a Pralay (holocaust) and all Vedantic Scriptures were lost, accept this shloka, the future generations would be able to recreate all Vedantic body of knowledge by contemplating on this verse alone. 
“That” in this verse refers to the unknown we are seeking to understand; The Supreme Being, Bhagwan, God, Khuda, Vahe Guru. (Reality, Truth, Consciousness). 
“This” refers to the World as we know it or experience it; the Cosmos. 
Study of Logic, (Set Theory from college math) tells us that two “Wholes” can not exist separately so they have to be one and one only. “This” manifests from “That” exists in “That” and when negated (through knowledge) from “That”, what remains is “That”. 
The example given by Shankaracharya to explain this shloka was that of rope and snake. When in the darkness of the night your grandchild comes running to you saying there is a snake in the front porch, you bring a flash light and find that what appeared to be snake was only the rope left there inadvertently during the day. So you see, the snake manifested from the rope, existed in the rope and when you removed the darkness of ignorance and negated the snake what remained was the rope. 
Vedantic literature is full of such verses which on the surface seem nonsensical but they require a teacher to explain them to us. This is why the wisdom portion of the Vedas is called Upanishad; that which is to be learned sitting at the feet of the teacher. Make it a part of your daily life.
