# GRAS & CRISCO

When we buy packaged food from market, we assume that it is safe to eat. The assumption is that some governmental or other organization must have ensured that the product is safe to eat. This is a wrong assumption. There is a concept called “GRAS”. This stands for “Generally Recognized as Safe”. Many foods and food additives fall into this category. You will be surprised to know that the burden of proof for the safety for these products lies with the food company. 

The best example of GRAS is “Vegetable Shortening” also known as Hydogenated Fat. In America the best known brand is “Crisco” and in India it used to be “Dalda”. The story goes like this:

William Proctor and his stepbrother James Gamble many many years ago used to make soap and Candles. Tired of paying high prices for their raw materials tallow and lard they developed a process to hydrogenate oils which are liquid at room temperature to convert them to solids so that candles and soaps can be manufactured from waste products like cotton seeds. At the turn of the 19th century with the advent of electricity and light bulb the demand for candles collapsed. Faced with this crises and in the light of growing health concerns of consuming animal fat (tallow and lard) they came up with a brilliant strategy to introduce “Crisco” as a healthy alternative to tallow and lard for cooking and baking. The rest is history. Crisco became an overnight success. 

It is only after 100+ years the scientific community realized, the fatal consequences of this product and it was banned in many states. The product is still legal in India. The status trans fats had enjoyed was GRAS.
