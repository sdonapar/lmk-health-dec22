# SOYA OR  NOT ?

One question often asked of me relates to eating Soya products. 
There are many soya products available in the market. 
- Edamame
- Soybeans
- Soya sauce
- Soya milk
- Tofu
- Tempeh
- Soya nuggets
- Soybean oil
- Soya protein powder

Of these soya bean oil and soya protein powder should be avoided. Others should be consumed in moderation. 

1. Is Soya milk healthy?
The question one has to ask is why do we want to make milk out of every thing. Can’t we consume the food as food. I think the answer has something to do with our addiction to tea and coffee. In all my health groups this becomes a hot topic after the discussion about milk. 

It is perfectly fine to make vegan milks at home and consume those. The ready made vegan milk may have preservatives added to them and that is not desirable. I have linked below a video of how to make various vegan milks. We all have different tastes and you need to find your own favorite. Those who have children who love milk may try making two different varieties so that a child is not overdosed on soya milk. 

2.How about Tofu?
Because of the heavy bias in the society for protein, as I discussed earlier, it has become a fashion in restaurants and homes, serving vegetarian food, to serve Paneer, Tofu and Soya nuggets. It is somehow believed that, if the meal is vegetarian, we must serve paneer and without that meal is incomplete. You go to any Indian party, there will be Paneer Tikka on the menus and saag paneer and mutter paneer and malai kofta. I have been to some Indian parties where there was not even a single dish that was vegan besides daal and I am not even talking whole food, because daal had ghee tadka. 

The story with tofu is similar. You go to a Chinese or Vietnamese or Korean restaurant and order vegetarian or vegan dishes they all will be full of tofu. This is because an average American believes that a vegan meal without Tofu is incomplete. Even the master chefs have this myth. 

Soya was not an Indian food. We ate daal and Rajma and chana instead. Soya was introduced to India in late 60s. Bulk of the soya produced around the world is fed to farm animals raised for food. 
In US 70% soya is used for animal feed and 5% for biodiesel. All soya produced in US is genetically modified (GMO).
On the scientific front there are some controversies over soya but all agree that in small amounts it is not harmful. There is nothing wrong in eating tofu in moderation. Take it only if you like it and want to have it. Don’t take it thinking it is health food. I personally prefer eating edamame (fresh soya beans); they taste great as appetizer.
