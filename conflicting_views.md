# 1.8 CONFLICTING VIEWS

For every video I post in this group there are ten videos on YouTube that oppose that view. There is too much money riding on these misleading information. Food and Pharma industries are huge and they have great interest in maintaining the status quo. We will discuss the subject of politics of food and pharma in the fourth week.
Many things I say here will be at odds with what doctors and dietitians are taught. But their curriculum is controlled by a governing body which is full of food and Pharma executives and lobbyists. 
Dr. Collin Campbell is the giant in nutrition community. But after his appearance in the documentary “ Forks over Knives”, he practically has been excommunicated. Under the pressure from food and Pharma industry who fund the Cornell university and sit on its board, his course in nutrition was cancelled and he was retired.
The fact that medical students are taught not a single course in nutrition is not just an oversight. It is massively planned campaign and it is apparent because in spite of requests by many PBWF doctors to add a course in nutrition it has been opposed by the authorities that decide on the curriculum. Okay
