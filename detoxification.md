# Detoxification

As I had mentioned in the very beginning of this group Detoxification is the second pillar of health. 

First some discussion about the cellular structure of our body. 
Cells are fundamental building blocks of all organisms.The human body is made up of over 10 trillion cells. A cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. The membrane separates the cytoplasm and nucleus from its external environment which contains the nutrients. After nutrients penetrate the cell membrane, they are metabolized and turned into energy that fuels the cell’s life functions. The by-products of this metabolic activity are waste that needs to be removed from the cell through the same cell membrane. Any impairment to a cells ability to let nutrients in or let the waste out leads to death by starvation or toxicity. (This concept in Yog is called Prana and Apana.)

As you can see from this discussion that detoxification is as important as nutrition. For good health it is not only necessary to 

(1) avoid absorption of toxins into our body by avoiding sources of toxins in our foods and environment, as listed yesterday,

(2) but also to engage in activities that facilitate their elimination. 

Clearly our goal should be to reduce the level of toxins we absorb and regularly engage in ways to detoxify our body. 

Food we consume is a major source of toxins. The other sources besides food are air we breathe, the water we drink (specially in India), the creams and lotions we apply to our body, the cleaning chemicals we apply to home surfaces etc. etc. Our body also makes toxins which are excreted through breadth, perspiration, urination and defecation.

Now the question comes how to remove these toxins from our body. The following list is an attempt to summarize various detoxification techniques.

1.Body’s natural responses
2.Body Cleansing 
3.Water Therapy
4.Fasting
5.Yoga (Kriya) Techniques
6.Colon Irrigation
7.Pranayama
8.Yoga (Asanas)
9.Walking

1.Body’s Natural Responses

Breathing,Sweating, Urinating and Bowl movement are body’s natural response by which toxins are regularly excreted. When we consume food which our body recognizes  as toxic, body’s natural response is to vomit it or pass it through colon as loose motion. 

2.Brushing teeth, Shower and Bath are part of our normal routine. Steam shower and Sauna are also good detox practices.

3.There are several techniques of doing water therapy. 

    3.1 Drinking 2-3 glasses of warm water first thing every morning is a good detox habit. One can add lemon juice and/or ginger juice and/or Alovera extract/Amla extract or turmeric or apple cider vinegar to the water.

    3.2 In Japanese Water therapy they recommend that one drinks one liter of water instead of 2-3 glasses. I do not know enough to recommend it but intuitively,  if at all, it should not be done more frequently than once a week.

    3.3 One of the Yoga techniques listed below as Dhoti (Varisara Dhoti aka. Shankhaprakshalana) is also a Water Therapy. 

4.Fasting:

Fasting is an ancient practice common in various forms in many cultures. It is no coincidence that the two Nobel prizes in Physiology in last four years have gone to research on this subject. I have discussed Intermittent fasting earlier. Dr. Jason Fung uses Intermittent fasting to treat all his Diabetic patients. True North Health Center in Santa Rosa California uses continuous fasting for up to 40 days to treat severely ill patients.

I advise everyone to do two 3-5 day water fast every year. I also recommend strongly 16:8 intermittent fasting. Other approaches are once a week or every two weeks or a monthly water fast. 
We will discuss more on this subject separately.  

5.Yoga Techniques:

In ancient Indian Yoga practices they have prescribed six techniques for internal cleansing. These are collectively known as Shatkarmas and include following:
5.1 Dhauti
5.2 Basti
5.3 Neti 
5.4 Tratka 
5.5 Nauli
5.6 Kapalbhati
With the exception of Kapalbhati and  Neti all others should only be done under expert supervision.

6.Colon Cleansing:

Here main goal is to clear the colon of large quantities of stagnant, supposedly toxic waste encrusted on colon walls. Doing so, would enhance the vitality of the body. It is also claimed that this improves the immune system. Two  of the Shatkarma techniques called Dhoti (Varisara) and Basti also achieves the same goal. 

7.Nadishodhan Pranayam:

Pranayam are the breathing techniques which help remove toxins. Amongst various techniques Nadishodhan specially is most effective and practicing it 15-20 minutes every morning can help the body tremendously. Kapalbhati another good technique, which is really a Kriya is listed under section 5.6.

8.Yoga Asanas:

Hath Yoga practice is a good way to detoxify our endocrine system. It also helps detoxify lymphatic system. 

9.Walking:

Walking is a very good way to detoxify our lymphatic system.  Every cell in our body eliminates waste and it goes either into our lymphatic system or into blood circulatory system. Lymphatic system does not have a pump like the blood circulating system. The only way it works is by the movement of the body. That is why I say that active lifestyle is very important. That explains the reason for my recommendation of 10,000 steps each day. It is also important to do some arm raises as a part of walking.
