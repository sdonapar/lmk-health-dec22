# TEA, COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE

On the subject of tea, I want to mention that tea was introduced to India by the British when they had trouble with China, some 170 years ago. There is nothing sacrosanct about tea. It has some nutrients but when we add milk and sugar they are neutralized. One can get more nutrients by having herbal tea (like ginger, lemon, cinnamon etc.).

Coffee also is not indigenous to India. It was only introduced in 1670s to Karnataka hills.  
The problem with beverages like tea, coffee and chocolate, is that caffeine in them is addictive, like any other addictive substance; tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, opium, etc.. The problem with any addiction is that it takes over the control of your body from you and starts dictating  it. It is like loosing your freedom. You can’t go to toilet without it. When you have to skip it for some reason you get headaches and can’t function properly. 

So my suggestion is to try and give it up. Some people with strong will power can give up addiction cold turkey where as others do it gradually. 

From purely health perspective, all three have some nutrients beneficial to health however not the way most of us consume them. The culprits are the sugar and milk we add to these beverages which neutralize the beneficial affects. If you must have them, consume them without milk and sugar and in moderation. I suggest you try giving up milk and sugar in your beverages first. Best is to add some lemon or cardamom to the black tea or try Kashmiri Kahwa which has no sugar or milk. You can also try green tea. 

You will also notice that biscuits or donuts go with milk in tea or coffee. Once you give up milk in tea giving up biscuits becomes easy. I gave up tea 7 years ago. For first few years I missed the routine of having a cup of hot beverage in the morning now even the idea doesn’t cross my mind. As soon as I get up I rush to toilet. No more waiting for tea to finish.
