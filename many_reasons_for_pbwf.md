# 1.4 Many Reasons for PBWF

The focus of this group is to reverse chronic diseases and get off chronic medications and we have seen that food choices we make help us achieve that. The same food choices also have a great impact on our environment and on the issue of cruelty to animals. 
There are many reasons for being Vegan:

1. Health
2. Cruelty to animals
3. Global warming 
4. Spirituality 

My focus has been the health but others are equally valid.
The documentary H.O.P.E. highlights the impact on environment of our choices about food. Paul McCartney said the following about this film:
“This important film highlights the choices we must make to help protect this planet and all its inhabitants.”

It is not necessary to watch this documentary now. You can view it at leisure when you have time.
