# SELECTING A JUICER

As green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations I advise that the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed. 
Specially for those people who are on medications or want to lose weight. There are 4 types of vegetable Juicers:

1. Two step Hydraulic juicer. This was developed by Dr. Norwalk in 1930s for his friend Dr. Gersen who cured cancer patients by juice therapy (More on that later when we cover cancer). 
This is the best juicer on the market and costs about $2,000.
A good choice is PURE juicer. I recommend it strongly. It may not be available in India. 

2. Double Helical Screw type. There are only two manufacturer of this type that I am aware of.
- Angel $1400 +/-
- Green Star $ 500+/-
I recommend both strongly. 
Angel is now available in India. 

3. Slow speed single augur type. Many manufacturers make these juicers and I recommend following three juicers:
1. Hurom
2. Kuving
3. Omega
These are priced in $200-400 range. 

4. High Speed Centrifugal as shown in the documentary “Fat Sick and Nearly Dead”.
These are least effective in extracting juice from leafy vegetables and also the high speed oxidizes the nutrients. I do not recommend these. 

You can tell the quality of these juicers by measuring the moisture in the pulp that is thrown out. The videos I have attached compare many of these models. There are many more videos on the YouTube which may be worth watching. The yield from different juicers can vary by as much as twice. Considering that you buy juicer once and produce every day and your time is also valuable, you can recover the extra cost within a year. Specially in US, if you are paying a maid to come twice a week to take out juice, just the labor cost becomes about 100 dollars per week. Organic produce is also expensive.
I recommend that you buy the best juicer you can afford. 
Please do not ask questions in the group like “What do you think of this model or that model” because no body has tried all juicers and juicing is such a rejuvenating experience that every body trying it loves it. So no matter what juicer they have purchased they all love them. As far as multiple models within the same brand they only differ in bells and whistles and the juicing mechanism usually is the same. Buy the model which is on sale. You won’t go wrong. If their is an accessory available to make nut butter, do buy it as it is very useful. Here are some videos on the subject.
