# Why One Diet for All Ills?

Most people who join my health group bring a belief with them that there must be a different diet plan recommendation  for different illnesses. Even though my post on the very first day of the session, clarifies that there is only one diet, for all ills, the most frequently asked questions is “I have following symptoms....x, y, z, what should my diet be?
This is probably the biggest myth, even surpassing the protein myth. 

Just imagine,  you were suffering  from diseases X, Y and Z and you were prescribed the
following diet:

For disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P

For disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R
and avoid  C, G, M, S & Q

For disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S
and avoid  A, G, K, P & T

Now, how will you figure out what to eat and what to avoid. The premise, that there is a special diet for every disease, is fundamentally flawed. When you eat PBWF diet with a diverse variety, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and all deficiencies are removed. So, there is no special need for supplements. Similarly, when you eat a variety of foods and allow your body to decide when you have had enough, as opposed to force feeding one supplement or the other, there are no excesses. There are exceptions to this rule, but most relate to (1) when you are eating processed refined foods which disturb the natural balance of nutrients (2) When you consume medications which may interfere with absorption of some nutrients over other (3) When you consume supplements, they interfere with body’s ability to absorb other nutrients, creating imbalances. 

It is for these reasons, my highest priority is, to help you get off medications and supplements (except B12). Once you achieve that, and are off all medications, your body recuperates and achieves a proper balance. My recommendation to “eat everything you like and some that you don’t” is to ensure that you are getting a diverse variety of food. My insistence on eating berries, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices is also to provide a diverse variety. Superfoods like Aamla, Giloy, Turmeric, Garlic, Haritaki, Tulsi, Bibhitaki etc. should be made a part of daily food recipes, rather than taking them as supplements. 
Those who know cooking, know that different spices need to be added in different amounts; you can’t add as much cayenne pepper as coriander powder in a dish. One obviously needs to learn these things as a part of cooking classes and not nutritional coaching. This is not my area of expertise, and my guideline is quite simple; listen to your body, if it likes the food have more, if it doesn’t agree with it, stop. 
Certain groups and organizations benefit from propagating this myth. They want you to believe that this is a very complex science and you need to visit them and under their supervision alone your health will improve. I remember when my wife visited Jindal Spa in Bangalore she was told that every patient will receive a different diet which is customized for them. It created a sense of awe as to how refined these people are. I see this happening all around. Ayurveda masters telling you that you have to visit there center and live for a month to get cured. This is not necessary. It is not a difficult science at all. You do not need to go to any spa or Ayurvedic retreat; you can realize the benefits at the privacy of your home. If you want to get pampered, then go to a spa but it isn’t necessary for the health reasons. These are all marketing gimmicks used to make you feel weak and deprived.
