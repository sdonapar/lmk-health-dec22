# FRESH vs LEFTOVERS

One question, that comes up often, is with reference to reheating foods. There seems to be lot of confusion on this issue. Some of what I am about to share may be controversial. 
Left over food stored in refrigerator may be safe to eat later but it does not mean it is as nutritious. The macro nutrients will mostly remain there but the micro nutrients diminish. 

One advantage of vegetables over animal food is that vegetable are rich in micronutrients; vitamins, antioxidants and phytonutrients like flavonoids and carotenoids. After vegetables (and fruits also) are picked these micronutrients begin to decay because of oxidation. This oxidation is a function of light, heat, air contact and time. The process is on a continuum but we often arbitrarily assign it a time factor. So when you read that vegetables remain fresh for a certain number of days, it is misleading because there is no step curve involved. 
There is a difference between a food becoming stale or rancid or  rotten and becoming less nutritious. Loss of micronutrients reduces nutritional value of food but it may still be healthy and able to provide macro nutrients; protein, carbohydrates and fat, which are sources of energy. Beyond a certain point the composition of macro nutrients also begins to change and food becomes toxic to the body. 

Certain fruits and vegetables are well protected by their skin like potatoes, onions, apples etc. and can stay fresh for months in cold storage, but others are exposed like leafy vegetables, berries etc.. Storing food in refrigerator reduces exposure to heat and light lengthening the nutritious life of the produce. Good refrigerators also have separate drawers for produce reducing air flow exposure. 

When fresh vegetables are cooked their micronutrient contents decay rapidly with time.   That is why it is advisable to eat freshly cooked food. Ideally the food should get ready after you have sat down on the dining table. Eating salad before meals provides that opportunity. In today’s busy life many people choose to prepare meals early, like cooking dinner also with lunch or making food and freezing it. These are all unhealthy practices and you are compromising on the micronutrients. This practice is less harmful for foods which are not primary source of micronutrients any way, like rice and bread but for vegetables you have lost all their advantages. 
Today’s complex food distribution system already has certain built in systemic disadvantages; produce is 2-3 days old already by the time we buy it. Then we store it in refrigerator for up to a week. So by the time you cook it, up to 50% micronutrients are already lost. Other factor to keep in mind is that when we peel and cut vegetables we expose the protected parts of the vegetables (and fruits); increasing their oxidation of nutrients. So the practice of storing peaked and chopped vegetables is not very healthy. 

REHEATING FOODS:
On the subject of reheating foods some additional factors come into play. 
When you reheat the vegetables the nitrates convert into nitrites which are harmful. Also some protein structures change upon reheating. 
Nitrites can have a reaction with hemoglobin within a human body, turning it into methemoglobin that is incapable of bonding with oxygen.

Therefore one should avoid reheating green leafy vegetable based dishes, beetroots, carrots, onions and garlic. 
There is also some evidence that certain protein structures change upon reheating and specially chicken and eggs should not be reheated in the microwave. 
Here is a video that covers the subject.
