# MY OATMEAL RECIPE

Oatmeal is one of the finest grain for breakfast. It is very rich in fiber low in glycemic and insulin loads and keeps you full for extended period of time. I recommend it to all and specially diabetics. 
Here is my recipe for a serving for two:
1. 4 tbsp. Steel cut Oatmeal 
2. 2 tsp. Ground Flaxseed 
3. 1 tsp. Chia Seed
4. 1 tsp. Sesame Seed
5. 2 or 3 Dates
6. 1 tbsp Raisin 
7.  Almond Milk 1/4 Cup
8. 5 Walnuts 
9. 1/4 tsp. Ground Ilaychi
10. 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon
11. 1/2 cup sliced Banana or Blue Berry or Mango or any other fruit of your choice.

Mix the first 7 ingredients with two cups of water and boil for 10-15 minutes. When ready add ilayachi, cinnamon, walnuts and fruits. 
The good thing about this breakfast is that it takes care of your daily requirement of nuts, seeds and omega-3. It tastes great and when combined with a glass of green juice and bowl of fruits, your breakfast takes care of two other food groups for the day.
