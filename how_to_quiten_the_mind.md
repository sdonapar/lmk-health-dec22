# How to Quiten the Mind?

It is easy to say to quieten the mind, then to achieve it. How should one go about quietening the mind? That is the subject of this post. 
From the time of birth, as we engage in this world we acquire certain vasanas. Vasanas are latent desires; desires which are yet to manifest to the surface. 
The example Swami Chinmayananda gave to explain this was, suppose you cut onions early in the morning to make breakfast, now throughout the day whenever you take your hands close to your nose you can smell onions. Another funny example he gave, is of a lady who in the morning poured a less expensive perfume in to the bottle of a very expensive French perfume, she will smell that perfume throughout the day whenever she takes her hands close to the nose. Or to give another example her husband poured black label whisky into the blue label bottle will smell that whisky throughout the day. That is what vasanas are. A lingering reminder of a past experience.

Vasanas can be related to your Body(B), Mind(M) or Intellect(I). 
1. The example of body related Vasanas would be desire for tea, coffee, olcohol or tobacco. The first time you consume coffee, or alcohol or tobacco, you don’t like it but you consume it for some other reason; may be to feel grown up or to belong to a clique that you admire. Or desire for a perfume by his wife. Till she had smelled it she was happy with the less expensive perfume but after smelling it she desires for that one. 
2. The example of mind related Vasanas would be the first attraction for a person of the opposite sex at the time of puberty. You like the feeling and fall in love and want to be with the person. Your love for your children, family and friends pulls you to be with them. 
3. The example of intellect related vasana would be your belief in certain ideology and desire to spread it. For example my desire to spread the knowledge about healthy living is a vasana. 
Some vasanas are egocentric for personal gain and satisfaction and some are driven by desire to help others. 

Our ancestral masters found that when we act in this world of Objects(O), Emotions(E) and thoughts(T) with an egocentric purpose, we develop more vasanas but when we engage with out egocentric desires, for the benefit of others, we do not develop additional desires. 

When there is a gap between what we want (W) and what we have (H), it becomes the source of our unhappiness. This gap may be at physical objects level or emotional level or intellectual level. This gap tends to preoccupy our mind and mind doesn’t quieten. To quieten the mind it is important that one works to reduce this gap. 

Happiness Delta = Wants - Haves

If this number is positive you are unhappy. The gap can be reduced by acquiring what you want, or reducing the wants. 
When you try to reduce this gap by acquiring more, the happiness realized is only momentary, because your Body, Mind and Intellect (BMI) is constantly changing with time and the world of Objects, Emotions and Thoughts (OET) is also constantly changing with time so you want to have more and newer things. As a result the gap never reduces. 
The other way that gap can be reduced is by reducing or eliminating the Wants. When you achieve that the happiness obtained is permanent. This is expressed well in the following couplet:

“Chaahat gayee, chinta gayee, manva beparwah. 
Jisko kachu na chahiye, voh he Shehan Shah.

So now the question boils down to “ how to reduce or eliminate” vasanas (latent desires). Our scriptures recommend three paths. The reason three paths are recommended are because all people are not alike. There are three types of people: 
1. Some people are physically oriented. Their body is the most predominant faculty in them. They are less emotionally or intellectually inclined. Approximately 90% people fall into this group.

2. Some are very emotionally inclined always focused on feelings and experiencing daily ups and downs. About 9% people are like that. 

3. The third group of people are highly intelligent and always asking questions; Why and Why not? The remaining 1% fall in this group. 
So for each of these three groups of people a separate path is recommended in our scriptures.

1. Karm Yoga is for the first group. Do what your duty is with out any attachment to results. Make sure that you enjoy the hike up to the mountain and reaching the top or not is irrelevant. If enjoyed the journey you will not get disappointed if don’t reach the top. The following couplet describes Karm Yoga well: “Seva me khush ho liye, gum se ghagraye nahin, zindagi kya hai, kyon hai, kuch samajh aaya nahin.”

2. Bhakti Yoga is for the second group. When you love people they may or may not reciprocate your love causing disappointment and unhappiness. So love them unconditionally; focus on what you feel for them and not what they feel for you. Also when you love God; Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Mohammad or Buddha, he always loves you back. 

3. Gynan Yoga or yoga of knowledge is for the intellectuals. Study of Scriptures gives us the wisdom to realize the follies of life. 
To summarize, yes one must quieten the mind but to do so follow the path appropriate for you.
