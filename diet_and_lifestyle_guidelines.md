# DIET & LIFESTYLE GUIDELINES 

As we discuss diet and lifestyle needed to cure chronic diseases, we must focus on bigger things first and foremost. The goal in this group is to improve the level of your health from where ever it is at currently, to an order of magnitude better and definitely get you off medications. My focus is on making the instructions very simple and easy to remember. Once we reach our goal of getting off all medications, we will start paying attention to some finer details.
Following are my Daily Dozen recommendations for diet and lifestyle:

1. No animal food. No Sea food. No eggs, and no dairy based milk or milk products (yogurt, cheese, butter or any other milk products). Nut based milk, yogurt and other products are fine. 
2. No refined or highly processed foods. No oil or sugar. If you are not on any chronic medications, or do not wish to reverse the disease (just maintain it at the current levels), two tsp. of ghee/oil and two tsp. of sugar maximum are allowed per day as exception. 
3. Eat from all five food groups: (1) fruits, (2) vegetables, (3) beens & legumes (4) grains and (5) nuts & seeds. Herbs & spices are highly recommended and should be eaten regularly. As a rule of thumb consume one fifth of your daily caloric intake from each food group. It can be varied from day to day. If you want to lose weight faster, eat only minimum recommended from the Nuts&Seeds group.
4. Eat a minimum of 1% of your body weight in fruits (must include berries) and a minimum of 1% of your body weight in vegetables (half in green leafy vegetables) daily. Those who are trying to reverse diseases or reduce weight, need to consume more from this group. 
5. Watch for three key nutrients: Omega-3, vitamin D-3 and vitamin B-12. To make sure that you are getting enough Omega-3: Eat 1 tbsp. Flaxseed (ground) and/or Chiaseed and five walnuts each  day. If you are trying to reverse disease you can eat more. Eat as much variety as you can; try to include one Brazil nut each week and men must eat pumpkin seeds. Take vitamin B-12 supplement; 50-100 mcg daily or 2,000 mcg weekly. It is best to get Vitamin D-3 from sun. Take D3 supplement only if you are deficient and you donâ€™t get in the sun much. Do not take any other supplements. 
6. Keep your body hydrated at all times. Drink minimum 1/2 liter of  warm water first thing in the morning before brushing teeth and one glass, an hour after dinner and one glass before going to bed. Rest of the day, eat your water, as much as possible by consuming fresh fruits and vegetables rich in water. 
7. Practice 16:8 Intermittent Fasting daily. Slowly reduce your eating window to 8-10 hours. Finish you dinner at least 3 hours before bedtime and preferably before it gets dark outside. 
8. Do therapeutic water only fast of 36 hours every two weeks (Ekadashi) and one or two 9 day water fasts each year. For 9 day fasts you can have one 500 calorie low protein (under 5%) meal each day before sunset. 
9. Stay active and get out in the daytime for some time even if there is no sun. Walk 10,000 steps or more daily. Do some cardio, stretching and stress exercises also. Do not exercise at night. 
10. Sleep a minimum of 7-9 hours daily. If a deficit develops during week, make up for it on the weekends. Switch off all blue light emitting devices at least one hour before bedtime, or apply filters to TV, computer screens and cell phones. 
11. Love your family and friends unconditionally and stay connected. 
12. Pray regularly and have a positive attitude full of gratitude. Who you pray to is not important, but that you pray is. 

No other restrictions. Eat variety of foods; everything you like and some that you donâ€™t. Eat as much as you feel like but do not force yourself. No portion control is necessary. After 6 months on PBWF/IF/10K program you should be able to rely totally on your bodyâ€™s instincts to chose food and how much to eat.

Some Additional Comments:
(A) One rule of thumb is that at least half of your total calories intake should come from uncooked foods. If you follow the recommended guidelines, it will happen naturally. You can eat some sprouted beans to increase the percentage of raw food. 
(B) Most Indians feel lost because they donâ€™t know how to cook subji without ghee/oil.  Here are a few suggestions:
1. You can sautÃ© onions and spices in few tablespoons of water or use vegetable stock. Watch the video below. 
3. You can add ground mustard seeds or nut butters like peanut or cashew butter. 
4. Use air fryers to replace deep frying or bake. 
5. Mix avocados into dough to make stuffed parathas. Avocados are 80% fat.
