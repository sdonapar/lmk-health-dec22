# FISH OIL FRAUD

I have repeatedly maintained that taking supplements is unwise (except for vitamin B-12). The food supplements industry is multi billion dollar industry and wants you to believe that food you have consumed for thousands of years, is some how deficient in nutrients, and therefore you need to take supplements. One such argument has been about need to consume DHA rich fish oil. They have maintained that human body can not convert enough ALA found in vegan sources of Omega-3 (flaxseed, walnuts etc.) and therefore fish oil supplements should be consumed. I had covered this in my post on Omega-3 (refer to post 2.28). 

Recently, it was announced in major newspapers that this practice might have been a fraud. 
A pair of rigorously scientific studies presented at the American Heart Associationâ€™s Scientific Sessions, provide seemingly indisputable evidence that fish oil has no effect whatsoever on cardiovascular health. The studies, tested thousands of subjects, found that taking fish oil supplements is just another weird thing food supplement industry dreamed up in the 1980s. This was published in the Wall Street Journal today (though I didnâ€™t care about the sarcasm on kale).ðŸ‘‡
